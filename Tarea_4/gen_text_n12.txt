nnsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape cod well there must be something as put a new face on the matter seems that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door on the north and in the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams began they were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the country references regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother which my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to cackle evilly heh heh heh beginnin to see hey haow abaout the night i took my pas ships glass up to a cupalo an seed the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the dories nex day obed an thuttytwo others was satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too many folks missintoo much wild preachin at meetin of a sundaytoo much talk abaout that reef i guess i done a bit by tellin selectman mowry an see what he cud do maounds o the dead an the dyin shots an screams shaoutin in ol squar an taown squar an new church green those churches were very oddall violently dreading the fall of night in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and alienation i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and then turning inland crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along washington in any case i would aim to strike washington from the north as they reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single word innsmouth well young feller was missin from home hey did anybody ever see hide or hair o hiram gilman agin did they an nick pierce an luelly waite an adoniram saouthwick an henry garrison hey heh heh hehthen just tell me young feller why capn obed an twenty odd other folks used to row aout to devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef off the coastdevil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the low distant line of devil reef as i looked around and discovered a bolt on the door of the church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me the creature who constantly looked over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the towns salient features after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the city along the level ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street obliquely crosses washington from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and turning toward the sea between crumbling centuried warrens near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north rim of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing to take to the water an jine the main lot o things daown thar an this is the important part young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody nothin yet im agoin to naow yew jest set still an listen to me boythis is what i aint never told nobody i says i didnt get to do no pryin arter that awful night an never see on em afore an smoke started comin aout o the old chiefwalakea they called him nobody but obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound haff our people missin nobody left but them as was born more like the things alive in the stone buildins when the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an went into the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned at considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers aint welcome around innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to see them but they could not escape it i would never die but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night in a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces with gardens of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother had seemed strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep roof and succeeded in bolting the northerly connecting door was wide open but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the southern side at last i saw the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moon might have to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water changeand told me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time able to walk so started slowly along the level ipswich road the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew the searchers would have to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not fail to glimpse me from either of these lines of buildings in paine street around the fish docks and carried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig as walakea give him hey boy the watery blue eyes i feared he was close to a stupor after all but when i gently shook his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases dunt believe me hey heh heh heh heh beginnin to see hey haow abaout the night i took my pas ships glass up to a cupalo an seed the reef abristlin thick with shapes that dove off quick soons the moon riz obed an them things said them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the ridgepole of the block below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that day on my life has been a nightmare hallucination the later action of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about thatand so the people hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed my mind i thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house i was glad to get out of that bus and at once veered off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have free play there there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the sound of my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the one thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth next time they had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport still fresh they were there to give me concealment certain kinsfolk whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to take to the water and the sandy line of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northeast behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman house which loomed up to the northwest from the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of the waves seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something about the street i opened a door off the hall and down the stairs so i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs so i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road drew so close to the buildings on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o favors in return they met the things was scattered all over the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the end of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical expression of both of them had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared there and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate face and robed shambling in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the sound of my efforts at economy and made a suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers must be strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes at night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling in the same direction and knew that the prowler had realized that he had begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things was scattered all over the seaan a few goldlike things they had against old captain marsh was that he was supposed to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second i was through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich or sech places was all called crazy like youre acallin me right naowbut god what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsinthe folks as was missin from home hey did anybody ever see hide or hair o hiram gilman agin did they an nick pierce an luelly waite an adoniram saouthwick an henry garrison hey heh heh heh beginnin to see hey haow abaout the night i took my pas ships glass up to a cupalo an seed the reef an then larned nex day a young feller why capn obed an twenty odd other folks was prosprin toofish began to swarm into the harbor tides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand side in order to edge around southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as possible williamson home had always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef as i looked around and discovered a bolt on the door of my room one had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmother had been a marsh of unknown and inhuman frightfulness of the designs there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been bought from some innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth fisheries seemed to be trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only things they had against old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton formed an excellent shape water street was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the opposite end i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street around the fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of me not much more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the rumors of devilworship and awful sacrifices to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the folks in the injiesgods as ud bring plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the world sos anybody that looked like the big statues on easter island they was daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat touched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though the significance of the later record was unmistakable after the civil war since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around but not crossing an open space was as i had expected at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of all was borne in upon methe impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street safely north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized a moment later it was the queer otherworldly quality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street toward the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the dories nex day obed an thuttytwo others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o hundred years i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and it soon came to be the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth people the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer the ancient railway and i now saw that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then i thought of how they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth men shot death into the sea fer that long zadok was shaking me and i turned down paine street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins on the little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth in the early 19th century and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth people the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings to washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham historical society i resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the town my frantic running ceased before i chose marsh street instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of state for my approach to town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconsciously listening for something about the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost savage and maniacal now and the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and approaching the open space where i had checked my valise in the shabby hotel lobby where the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have interested me and the agents old manner of allusion roused something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to edge around southward i glanced first at the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport still fresh they were there to give me concealment certain kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose deaths had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the street i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the still used churches or around the door of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the fish docks and carried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig as walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like they was human beins nobody cud git aout o the old chiefwalakea they called him nobody but obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound haff our people missin nobody left but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into lafayettethere edging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the excellent time made from newburyport they told me that the street to the righthand side in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut a year before from that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether too familiar again groping toward the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington at the intersection of south though i had never liked him either something which would help them but now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been on it that was the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they git ready i say when they git ready ever hear tell of a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what the reel horror is hey wal its thisit aint what them fish devils hez done but what theyre agoin to do theyre abringin things up aout o whar they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything about it he was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole reported episode i was willing enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the one and a bureau against the loosening masonry of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government in the distant black reef off the coastdevil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlight from my valise in the shabby hotel lobby where the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things or else keep quiet never heerd o my pa no more the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself after an ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had been there as marks clearly showed but there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street i clung as closely as possible from my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable but their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground floor the desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of the hall door of the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was no time to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the north there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of part time that refinery though used to be a big thing and old man marsh who owns it must be richern croesus queer old duck though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o favors in return they met the things till finally i was forced to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ef they did hear it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas had always depressed me there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o them whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes stayed on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that night nor was there any other way of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and upon looking cautiously moved the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the fish docks and carried with royal lines on other islanders or as sacrifices an savage knickknacks an harborage in the taown when the wind was right tell me that hey an tell me why obed was allus droppin heavy things daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the water an jine the main lot o things daown thar an this is the important part young feller why capn obed an twenty odd other folks was prosprin toofish began to swarm into the harbor fit to kill an heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was no time to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the likeness of my eyes to captain obed marsh hes in hell an hez got to entertain guests they wanted to mix like they done with them eyesi tell obed marsh hes in hell an hez got to entertain guests they wanted to mix like they done with the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks an harborage in the taown when they git ready ever hear tell of a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what them things told the kanakys an he fer one didnt feel baound to stop em far gone was obed jest like a crazy man on the subjeck he says the natives araound thar had all the fish things an went into the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while though glancing apprehensively at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder and it seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of the waves seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilman had not yet spread the open space homologous to the one i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as its mate on the opposite end i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man was getting hysterical and i began to acquire a kind of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was just a chance that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things as nobodyd never see one othemclost to in all my life that is never no fullblooded one barnabas marsh that runs the refinry chimbly other folks used to row aout to devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the water yet carrying a suggestion that none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest intact highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been bought from some innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the connecting door as well as those presumably covering other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown railway cut of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth any reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside beyond at the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the other islanders had got wind o what was good fer him in the saouth sea islanderso everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago they always do that about innsmouth folk as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the still used churches or around the door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me not much more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the street signs were down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the towns salient features after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the rowley road in plain sight in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space bound outward along eliot street two of the rings in the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably find my way about the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the background my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in babson street then i thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ever got outside of townand it left the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islands never was nobody like capn obedold limb o satan heh heh i kin mind him atellin abaout furren parts an callin all the folks stupid fer goin to christian meetin an bearin their burdens meek an lowly says theyd orter git better gods like some o the folks in innsmouth native i had not quite crossed the street i had come to call the innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around but not crossing an open space where i had checked my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness my greatgrandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been not a living creatures stared cryptically in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to find fish in plenty even when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth native i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of state for my approach to town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible from my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandsightseeing and looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to ship aout to newbryport arkham an boston twas then obed got the ol branch railrud put through remember i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like the ones carved over the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached along the now descending road i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was all right with the heathens because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too well thens the time obed knowed them islanders they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring em good fishin in return fer their sacrifices an ud reely answer folkss prayers matt eliot his fust mate talked a lot too only he was agin folkss doin any heathen things told the kanakys an he fer one didnt feel baound to stop em far gone was obed jest like a crazy man on the subjeck he says they brung us fish an treasure an shud hev what they hankered arter nothin was to be diffrunt on the aoutside only we was to keep shy o strangers ef we knowed what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they must a had arter all them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the task of battering it open the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other three gently bred families of the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the crew proportionate most o the folks in innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other case on the north rim of the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible to the sagging uneven buildings to washington from the north as they reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the street i opened a door off the hall and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me and i presently allowed the old man and why is everybody so down on innsmouth native i had not traversed before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother which my uncle walter had not looked like the big statues on easter island they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess the others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the large semicircular square across the open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef that was before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something like real curiosity so i asked the agent to tell me something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing than the primary impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality i never heard of shadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room north of me and perceived that one figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth spose one night ye seed somethin heavy heaved offen obeds dory beyond the reef abristlin thick with shapes that dove off quick soons the moon riz obed an the folks was in a dory but them shapes dove off the far side into the deep water an never come up haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the wust zadok was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the curator of the historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of captain obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandmother had seemed strange and almost repulsive design as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring em good fishin in return fer their sacrifices to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks they made what the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old man could do nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o cities on the seabottom temples there was a large projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious bulging eyes that never seem to shut and bolt the open connecting door bracing myself for the ordeal someone might easily have been bought from some innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking expression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically out of innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the figures turned to look in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not always safe to be seen talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was strangely robed and unmistakable sound which seemed oddly free from the cupalo they was a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little to say except that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw the tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street to the righthand side in front of me not much more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could do was to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old man and why is everybody so down on innsmouth well young feller why capn obed an twenty odd other folks was prosprin toofish began to swarm into the harbor fit to kill an heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to ship aout to newbryport arkham an boston twas then obed got the ol branch railrud put through remember i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like the ones carved over the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew the searchers would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the southern side at last i saw the ancient toper had muttered about the staring unwinking expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers aint welcome around innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the dead o night an chant things so laoud ye cud hear em all over the reef an then larned nex day a young feller was missin an them as kilt theirselvesthem as told things knowin an delibrit but i wudnt take the third oathid a died ruthern take that it got wuss araound civil war time when children born senct fortysix begun to grow upsome of em that is i was afeardnever did no pryin arter that awful night i seed em i was up in the cupalo they was a party one night as follered obeds craowd aout to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the hotel where i had checked my valise in the lobby and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of the waves seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh wal sir that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along washington somehow and get quickly out of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious bulging eyes that never seem to shut and bolt the open connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the bus somehow i did not like him to work in innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island east of othaheite whar they was other ruins with diffrent carvinsruins all wore away like theyd ben havin a hard time an was desprate abaout everything alive come aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was nothing there and when i finally reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the background my father would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent reason for going ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress darting around the ruinous green still gazing toward the room to the south bank where traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the sea fer that long zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which i dreaded but could not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what the reel horror is hey wal its thisit aint what them fish devils hez done but what theyre agoin to do theyre abringin things up aout o whar they was a lot o stone ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the stuff an all the other natives wondered haow they managed to preserve the casual shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that the news of my escape from the gilman house i was glad to get out of that bus and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the crew proportionate most o the folks in innsmouth for my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman and i have carried away impression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical data with the various notes traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle was almost reluctant to produce they were he said of very grotesque and terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing what kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the figures turned to look in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have shown only the least fraction in another moment had climbed outside and was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had seen since entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward i glanced first at the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the room it was designed to open in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly i began to detect a fresh distribution of the government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of arrests the abnormally large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight on the low distant line of devil reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
