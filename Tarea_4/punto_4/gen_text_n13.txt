rned queer even fer kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o them whar they got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o favors in return they met the things alive in the stone buildins when the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water soon the sound of my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination have been repeated under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives made it unsafe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of us took them as ud help special ud git special rewardsgold an sech no use balkin fer they was millions of em daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices an savage knickknacks they made what the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things said them as was born more like the things they wore ast em whar

refinry chimbly other folks used to row aout to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the country references to decline were few though the significance of the later record was unmistakable sound which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution by the present town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of waterfalls became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source whose husband lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the street signs were down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the towns salient features after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south a suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical shamble of the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas had always depressed me there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more hateful as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
