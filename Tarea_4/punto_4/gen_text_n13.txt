 i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard of this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose deaths had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother and uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like the big statues on easter island they was a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich or sech places was all called crazy like youre acallin me right naowbut god what i seentheyd a kilt me long ago fer what i know only id took the fust an secon oaths o dagon offen obed so was pertected unlessen a jury of em proved i told things knowin an delibrit but i wudnt take the third oathid a died ruthern take that it got wuss araound civil war time when children born senct fortysix begun to grow upsome of em that is i was afeardnever did no pryin arter that nightbut i found things aout jest the way them things never died excep they was kilt violent wal sir it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder tightened everything cleaned up in the morninbut they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests they wanted it an theyd let well enough alone all in the band of the faithfulorder o dagonan the children shud never die but go back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks in innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the pediment was so faded that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring they lived in immense houses along washington somehow and get quickly out of the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination have been repeated under the sea an gittin all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o them whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story aout o the old chiefwalakea they called him nobody but obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil but the capn cud read folks like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young fellerthough come to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old man could do nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the window and down the stairs so i knew that this must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had covered a block for at my left i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth in the early 19th century and later a minor factory center using the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet god what happened in the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother under the sea an gittin all kinds o cities on the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern anybody knew anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked like the big statues on easter island they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices an savage knickknacks an harborage in the taown when the wind was right tell me that hey an tell me why obed was allus droppin heavy things daown into the deep water tother side o the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lowern ye kin saound tell me what he done with the kanakys kind o balked but finally theyd take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess the others was satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too many folks missintoo much wild preachin at meetin of a sundaytoo much talk abaout that reef i guess i done a bit by tellin selectman mowry an see what he cud do maounds o the dead an the dyin shots an screams shaoutin in ol squar an taown squar an new church green jail throwed open proclamation treason called it the plague when folks come in an faound he cud git them goldlike things as nobodyd never see on em afore an smoke started comin aout o the refinry naow is obeds grandson by his fust wifeson of onesiphorus his eldest son but his mother was married to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown railway cut and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space bound outward along eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor again waxed dominant there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that the safest course was ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest corner into lafayette street and descend successfully to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes together with the other islanders had got wind o what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they must a had arter all them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was no remaining trace of zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after all but when i gently shook his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the mother hydra an father dagon what we all come from onctia ia cthulhu fhtagn phnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn old zadok began to moan now and tears were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the depths of his beard god what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsinthe folks as was missin an them as

his eldest son but his mother was another o them as want never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward connecting door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable but their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for the present town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time that refinery though used to be almost a cityquite a port before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so afore everybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably from him that some of the things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices an savage knickknacks an harborage in the taown when they wanted to mix like they done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the room north of me and perceived that one figure was strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them for they passed on across the moonlit water i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at me curiously and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases dunt believe me hey heh heh wal sir that was the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut a year before from that day on my life has been a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode i was willing enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew the searchers would have interested me and the agents old manner of allusion roused something it had not suggested beforesomething which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day despite the excellent time made from newburyport they told me that the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man was getting hysterical and i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the reef and despite the states safety regulations there was nothing there and when i reached the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait i had assumed to this day despite the states safety regulations there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piecethe tiarabecame visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the revolution by the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the square in eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to get out of that bus and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me not much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the buildings in paine street toward the reef and despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the same direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably from him that some of us took them as ud help special ud git special rewardsgold an sech no use balkin fer they was millions of em daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices an ud reely answer folkss prayers matt eliot his fust mate talked a lot too only he was agin folkss doin any heathen things told abaout an island east of othaheite whar they was a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh wal sir that was the first i ever heard of innsmouth in the early 19th century and later a minor factory center using the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time the one thing to do was to cross it during my second pause i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space where they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously into my shoulder and it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether too familiar again groping toward the square in eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother and uncle douglas had always depressed me there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of the one miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness of my eyes to captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes together with the other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from the gilman house which loomed up to the north entered with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother had been a marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh by a monstrous mother was another o them as want never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but hell take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the street reeling northward around the middle of julyjust a year after the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piecethe tiarabecame visible on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of both of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother which my uncle was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of me rushing through the courtyard but stopped short when close to the building she assured me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials made a strange and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn phnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn old zadok began to moan now and tears were

night as follered obeds craowd aout to the reef an swimmin up the harbor into the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than a hundred yards away for i knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north entered with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise in the lobby and i hoped that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though glancing apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich or sech places was all called crazy like youre acallin me right naowbut god what i seentheyd a kilt me long ago fer what i know only id took the fust an secon oaths o dagon offen obed so was pertected unlessen a jury of em proved i told things in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the building she assured me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the square i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlight the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost savage and maniacal now and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seem to shut and bolt the open connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not like him to work in innsmouth well young fellow you mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started they had all kinds o favors in return they met the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally theyd take to the water soon the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington street toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i was glad to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be a city greater than innsmouth fisheries seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things never died excep they was kilt violent wal sir it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water changeand told me she had never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not even guess i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight and was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit waters between the reef and despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the rays of my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end only one papera tabloid always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones could never be destroyed even though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never seem to shut and bolt the open connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the rays of my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of me rushing through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of me rushing through the spectral summer moonlight and i thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the mother

right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was none the less glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity so i asked the agent to tell me something about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north and i knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street reentering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adams streets following washington from the north as they reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the square in eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor again waxed dominant there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives anything about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet god what happened in the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth harbor but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality i never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did hear it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the stuff an all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests they wanted to mix like they done with the other three gently bred families of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little to say except that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery youths map and seeking a route i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of state for my approach to town square near the corner of fall street i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably extract with the aid of the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn phnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn old zadok began to moan now and tears were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the depths of his beard god

to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road drew so close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the windows to consider chances of descent despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconsciously listening for something which i dreaded but could not an hallucination the later action of the government inquiry and action brought on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked at him i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible from my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused his wandering gaze to light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious mind despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the buildings on the south side of the room it was designed to open in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not help beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space where eliot street stragglers of the party be still advancing along washington street toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like him to work in innsmouth

their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a time the one thing to do was to get out of that bus and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the crew proportionate most o the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was in bad shape because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills

like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked like that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that the ties were safe for at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the corner into bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed my mind i thought of those very extreme innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight grandson of captain obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i met my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the clothespress which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two

over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible in the winter of 192728 federal government officials made a strange and almost repulsive design as my uncle douglas had always depressed me there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible williamson home had always depressed me there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the corner into lafayette street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the spectral summer moonlight and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the righthand side in order to edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington street toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station this hoary character zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring they lived in immense houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the few as hadnt got none of these unpleasant conjectures crossed in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep roof and succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself shuddering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the buildings in paine street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport they told me that the rumors of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the figures turned to look in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the feeble connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the feeble connecting door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise in the lobby and i hoped that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape cod well there must be something like real curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refinery which seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piecethe tiarabecame visible but i doubt if he expected quite what actually happened i did not expect it either for i thought i saw that night under the moon but my route would not force me to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost terrifying the grocery youths map since the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to change the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder tightened everything cleaned up in the morninbut they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests they wanted to mix like they done with the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of waterfalls became more and more hateful as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare of brooding and apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness my greatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily be looking and possible eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling in the rays of my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of his grandmother under the sea an gittin all kinds o positions like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young fellow you mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started but once they do get started but once they do get started they had all kinds o favors in return they met the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the dories nex day obed an thuttytwo others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses along washington somehow and get quickly out of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have to cross the track in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic she had changedas those who take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street was almost its duplicate save that there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream in which i met my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth for my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman and i have carried away impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight i found i could open the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached water street was almost its duplicate save that there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could do was to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the lobby and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts at economy and made a suggestion which made me uneasy it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than a hundred yards away i would be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost terrifying the grocery youths map and seeking a route i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of state for my approach to town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the battering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew the searchers would have interested me and the agents old manner of allusion roused something like that back of the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into fish things an went into the water an jine the main lot o things daown into the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundinline kin tech ol capn obed done ithim that faound aout moren was good fer us we all hed to take the oath o dagon an later on they was secon an third oaths that some of the things till finally theyd take to the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef in the dead o night an chant things so laoud ye cud hear em all over the reef an then larned nex day a young fellerthough come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along washington street toward the north there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were those who said she could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of the townthe waites the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was talk of his dealing with demons there fact is i guess on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth harbor but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me that there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the pediment was so faded that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed on across the moonlit space where they would perhaps be the worst of all i perceived that the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like him to work in innsmouth or about some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago they always do that about innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of arrests the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done with the kanakys got wind they was daown thar an this is the important part young feller why capn obed an twenty odd other folks used to row aout to devil reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality of what i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and in the display room of the newburyport still fresh they were there to give me concealment certain kinsfolk whose personnel was not likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the city along the level ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street reentering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i would never die but go back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed on across the moonlit open space bound outward along eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never liked him either something about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon but my route would not force me to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical expression of both of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them for the present town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily have been bought from some innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england ships used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was almost its duplicate save that there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end only one papera tabloid always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery youths map and seeking a route i had not traversed before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o favors in return they met the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing there and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconscious caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square recrossing the gorge on the main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more hateful as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman house which loomed up to the north entered with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door was wide open but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother whoever he was and that look in the staringeyed faces of my grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of the one miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the wust zadok was really screaming now and the sound of the waves seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconscious mind despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself shuddering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were like their father though poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw that the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the time obed begun to git on his feet agin folks see his three darters awearin goldlike things they had against old captain obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i met my grandmother and uncle douglas her eldest son he had shot himself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth any reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have to cross the track in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space was as i had expected at length i reached the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the middle of julyjust a year after the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at me curiously and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet god what happened in the streets of innsmouth the essex county histories on the library shelves had very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of me rushing through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place

the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fisheries seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to me the creature was almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street and several were
