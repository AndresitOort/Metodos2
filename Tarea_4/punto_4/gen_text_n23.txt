side me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon but my route would not force me to cross it during my second pause i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space bound outward along eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction and knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily be looking and possible eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth native i had not quite crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of those very extreme innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to show it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were those who said she could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes was obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgreatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother whoever he was and that look in the staringeyed faces of my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses of blackness and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes it was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream in which i met my grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces with gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them for the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
