e he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there was talk of his dealing with demons there fact is i guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef that was before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks in innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder tightened everything cleaned up in the morninbut they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests they wanted to mix like they done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the things they had against old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the door of the gilman house i was glad to see the moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably shut me up in a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouth any reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have interested me and the agents old manner of allusion roused something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street safely north of the green and entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adams streets following washington street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the corner of fall street i began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers and when i finally reached the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh was that he was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth that night they rattled our door but pa wouldnt open then he clumb aout the kitchen winder with his musket to find selectman mowry what i see from the cupalo they was a party one night as follered obeds craowd aout to the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the dories nex day obed an thuttytwo others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the sea fer that long zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though glancing apprehensively at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh

battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door was wide open but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce they were he said of very grotesque and almost repulsive design as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piecethe tiarabecame visible but i doubt if he expected quite what actually happened i did not expect it either for i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done in that brierchoked railway cut a year before from that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library looking up data about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for something which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was nothing there and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight i found i could open the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner i walked rapidly softly and close to the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government in the end only one papera tabloid always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth one of the things they had against old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess the others was satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too many folks missintoo much wild preachin at meetin of a sundaytoo much talk abaout that reef i guess i done a bit by tellin selectman mowry an see what he cud do maounds o the dead an the dyin shots an screams shaoutin in ol squar an taown squar an new church green jail throwed open proclamation treason called it the plague when folks come in an faound haff our people missin nobody left but them as ud jine in with obed an them things or else keep quiet never heerd o my pa no more the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the things they had against old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn phnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn old zadok began to moan now and tears were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the depths of his beard god what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsin he stopped again and from

kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked like that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the opposite end i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh heh heh the old man was getting hysterical and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me not much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the opposite end i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother under the sea onct an with picters o monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i would never die but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night in a frightful dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
