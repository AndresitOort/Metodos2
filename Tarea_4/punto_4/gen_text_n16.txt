railrud put through remember i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the water soon the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him that awful night i seed em i was up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of em all over the reef an swimmin up the harbor into the manuxet god what happened in the streets of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of arrests the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did hear it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the sea an gittin all kinds o favors in return they met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic island near thar too whar they was other ruins with diffrent carvinsruins all wore away like theyd ben under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things they had against old captain marsh was that he was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface thats haow the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to stop over at the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport they told me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient massachusetts seaport of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of arrests the

wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth harbor but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth for my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman and i have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode i was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality i never heard of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother had been a marsh of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in the winter of 192728 federal government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had never liked him either something about it he was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said innsmouth well young fellow you mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape cod well there must be something like real curiosity so i asked the agent to tell me something about it he was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so afore everybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them poor mattmatt he allus was agin ittried to line up the folks on his side an had long talks with the preachersno usethey run the congregational parson aout o taown an the methodist

his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early 19th century and later a minor factory center using the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses of blackness and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet

collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable but their crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that one figure was strangely robed and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar again groping toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to shiver with a

shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon hall at new

despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew his tale could be nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory

oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after all but when i gently shook his shoulder he turned on me with astonishing alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases dunt believe me

street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one

is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had never liked him either something about it he was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time that refinery though used to be a big thing and old man marsh who owns it must be richern croesus queer old duck though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight grandson of captain obed marsh who founded the business his mother seems tove been some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago they always do that about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the oldtimers tell about the black reef off the coastdevil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the things they had against old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to show it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar again groping toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done in that brierchoked railway cut a year before from that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness my greatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce they were he said of very grotesque and almost repulsive design as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piecethe tiarabecame visible but i doubt if he expected quite what actually happened i did not expect it either for i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on

myself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient massachusetts seaport of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of arrests the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space bound outward along eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction and knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible

still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle douglas had always disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested beforesomething which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew his tale could be nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them poor mattmatt he allus was agin ittried to line up the folks on his side an had long talks with the preachersno usethey run the congregational parson aout o taown an the methodist

caff an the idols o canaan an the philistinesbabylonish abominationsmene mene tekel upharsin he stopped again and from the look in his watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for something which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother had been a marsh of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of

that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of how they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruined warehouse on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them poor mattmatt he allus

wears clothes but hell take to the water an quittin the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to take to the water soon the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent and little by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library looking up data about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i met my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical society i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich or sech places was all called crazy like youre acallin me right naowbut god what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsin he stopped again and from the look in his watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government in the end only one papera tabloid always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth one of the things they had against old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the oldtimers tell about the black reef off the coastdevil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth harbor but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth for my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman and i have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode i was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality i never heard of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution by the present town square recrossing the gorge on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street was almost its duplicate save that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years or so afore everybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the few as hadnt got none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the island but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess the others was satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too

the faithfulorder o dagonan the children shud never die but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night in a frightful dream in which i met my grandmothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmother and uncle douglas her eldest son he had shot himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in the winter of 192728 federal government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university at arkham and in the display room of the newburyport historical society i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them

though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight grandson of captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed

queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folk as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmother and uncle douglas had always disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested beforesomething which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable but their crouching shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in the winter of 192728 federal government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look

explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened whitely in the moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house i was glad to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces with gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas had always disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested beforesomething which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas had always disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested beforesomething which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures turned to look in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now and the dirty white beard bristled electrically old zadok probably saw me shrink back for he began to cackle evilly heh heh heh heh the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth spose one night ye seed somethin heavy heaved offen obeds dory beyond the reef an then larned nex day a young feller was missin from home hey did anybody ever see hide or hair o hiram gilman agin did they an nick pierce an luelly waite an adoniram saouthwick an henry garrison hey heh heh wal sir that was the

satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too many folks missintoo much wild preachin at meetin of a sundaytoo much talk abaout that reef i guess i done a bit by tellin selectman mowry what i see from the cupalo they was a party one night as follered obeds craowd aout to the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the dories nex day obed an thuttytwo others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the sea fer that long zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though glancing apprehensively at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him that awful night i seed em i was up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of em all over the reef an swimmin up the harbor into the manuxet god what happened in the streets of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of arrests the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government in the end only one papera tabloid always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of those very extreme innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other islanders had got wind o what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they must a had arter all them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic island near thar too whar they was other ruins with diffrent carvinsruins all wore away like theyd ben under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o positions like they was human beins nobody cud git aout o them whar they got all the stuff an all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of em things went on that way fer years an obed got enough o that goldlike stuff to make him start the refinery in waites old rundaown fullin mill wall come abaout thuttyeightwhen i was seven year oldobed he faound the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the few as hadnt got none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the island but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things till finally theyd take to the water changeand told me she had never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i

years ago they always do that about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years or so afore everybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like real curiosity so i asked the agent to tell me something about the staring unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to work in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university at arkham and in the display room of the newburyport historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were like their father though poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu
