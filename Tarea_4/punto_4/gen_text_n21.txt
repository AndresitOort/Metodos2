things up aout o whar they come from into the taownben doin it fer years an slackenin up lately them haouses north o the river betwixt water an main streets is full of emthem devils an what they brungan when they git ready i say when they git ready i say when they git ready i say when they git ready i say when they git ready ever hear tell of a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what them things bei seen em one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable but their crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that one figure was strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth any reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have interested me and the agents old manner of allusion roused something like real curiosity so i asked the agent to tell me something about it he was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich or sech places was all called crazy like youre acallin me right naowbut god what i seentheyd a kilt me long ago fer what i know only id took the fust an secon oaths o dagon offen obed so was pertected unlessen a jury of em proved i told things knowin an delibrit but i wudnt take the third oathid a died ruthern take that it got wuss araound civil war time when children born senct fortysix begun to grow upsome of em that is i was

do theyre abringin things up aout o whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story aout o the old chiefwalakea they called him nobody but obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil but the capn cud read folks like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young fellerthough come to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did hear it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the sea an gittin all kinds o favors in return they met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface thats haow the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was all right with the heathens because theyd ben havin a hard time an was desprate abaout everything they give a sarten number o young folks to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks they made what the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time that refinery though used to be a big thing and old man marsh who owns it must be richern croesus queer old duck though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight grandson of captain obed marsh who founded the business his mother seems tove been some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago they always do that about innsmouth people and folks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man and why is everybody so down on innsmouth well young fellow you mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the oldtimers tell about the black reef off the coastdevil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the things they had against old captain marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at night when the tide was right maybe he did for i dare say the rock formation was interesting and its just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there was talk of his dealing with demons there fact is i guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef that was before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks in innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from china or somewhere by the shipping it surely was bad enoughthere was riots over it and all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape cod well there must be something like that back of the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth any reference to a town not shown on

like that back of the innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green those churches were very oddall violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folks todayi dont know

it for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle douglas had always disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested beforesomething which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce they were he said of very grotesque and almost repulsive design as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piecethe tiarabecame visible but i doubt if he expected quite what actually happened i did not expect it either for i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done in that brierchoked railway cut a year before from that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness my greatgrandmother had been a marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness of my eyes to captain obeds in arkham too the curator had told me i had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes was obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgreatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother had been a marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness of my eyes to captain obeds in arkham too the curator had told me i had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo from boston and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal in september i entered oberlin for my final year and from then till the next june was busy with studies and other wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connection with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the middle of julyjust a year after the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas her eldest son he had shot himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were those who said she could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for data which i knew would

when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas her eldest son he had shot himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had never liked him either something about the staring unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream in which i met my grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them for the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
