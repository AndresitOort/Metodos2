eck them for the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
