to land on it sometimes at night when the tide was right maybe he did for i dare say the rock formation was interesting and its just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there was talk of his dealing with demons there fact is i guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef that was before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks in innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from china or somewhere by the shipping it surely was bad enoughthere was riots over it and all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape cod well there must be something like that back of the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the essex county histories on the library shelves had very little to say except that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early 19th century and later a minor factory center using the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the country references to decline were few though the significance of the later record was unmistakable after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university at arkham and in the display room of the newburyport historical society i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me uneasy it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i was glad to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adams streets following washington street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street reentering the square i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street around the corner of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundinline kin tech ol capn obed done ithim that faound aout moren was good fer him in the saouth sea islands never was nobody like capn obedold limb o satan heh heh i kin mind him atellin abaout furren parts an callin all the folks stupid fer goin to christian meetin an bearin their burdens meek an lowly says theyd orter git better gods like some o the folks in the injiesgods as ud bring em good fishin in return fer their sacrifices an ud reely answer folkss prayers matt eliot his fust mate talked a lot too only he was agin folkss doin any heathen things told abaout an island east of othaheite whar they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked like the big statues on easter island they was a little volcanic island near thar too whar they was other ruins with diffrent carvinsruins all wore away like theyd ben under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o positions like they was human beins nobody cud git aout o them whar they got all the stuff an all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things they wore ast em whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story aout o the old chiefwalakea they called him nobody but obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil but the capn cud read folks like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young fellerthough come to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did hear it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the sea an gittin all kinds o favors in return they met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface thats haow the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was all right with the heathens because theyd ben havin a hard time an was desprate abaout everything they give a sarten number o young folks to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks they made what the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an jine the main lot o things daown thar an this is the important part young fellerthem as turned into fish things an went into the water wouldnt never die them things never died excep they was kilt violent wal sir it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water an quittin the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o hundred years or so afore everybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the few as hadnt got none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the island but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of em things went on that way fer years an obed got enough o that goldlike stuff to make him start the refinery in waites old rundaown fullin mill wall come abaout thuttyeightwhen i was seven year oldobed he faound the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the other islanders had got wind o what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they must a had arter all them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the master of a ship genlly profited the crew proportionate most o the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was in bad shape because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too well thens the time obed he begun acursin at the folks fer bein dull sheep an prayin to a christian heaven as didnt help em none he told em hed knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin ye reely need an says ef a good bunch o men ud stand by him he cud mebbe git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them poor mattmatt he allus was agin ittried to line up the folks on his side an had long talks with the preachersno usethey run the congregational parson aout o taown an the methodist

aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but hell take to the water soon the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent and little by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or out toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the

things bei seen em one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing that i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister

of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i was glad

eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i was glad to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adams streets following washington street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street reentering the square i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street around the corner of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the

somethin ye reely need an says ef a good bunch o men ud stand by him he cud mebbe git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them poor mattmatt he allus was agin ittried to line up the folks on his side an had long talks with the preachersno usethey run the congregational parson aout o taown an the methodist feller quitnever did see resolved babcock the baptist parson aginwrath

was another o them as want never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but hell take to the water soon the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent and little by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or out toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the wust zadok was really screaming now and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me

they git ready i say when they git ready ever hear tell of a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what them things bei seen em one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing that i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a

right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but hell take to the water soon the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent and little by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or out toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the wust zadok was really screaming now and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me more than i care to own curse ye dunt set

ready ever hear tell of a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what them things bei seen em one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing that i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundinline kin tech ol capn obed done ithim that faound aout moren was good fer him in the saouth sea islands never was nobody like capn obedold limb o satan heh heh i kin mind him atellin abaout furren parts an callin all the folks stupid fer goin to christian meetin an bearin their burdens meek an lowly says theyd orter git better gods like some o the folks in the injiesgods as ud bring em good fishin in return fer their sacrifices an ud reely answer folkss prayers matt eliot his fust mate talked a lot too only he was agin folkss doin any heathen things told abaout an island east of othaheite whar they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked like the big statues on easter island they was a little volcanic island near thar too whar they was other ruins with diffrent carvinsruins all wore away like theyd ben under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o positions like they was human beins nobody cud git aout o them whar they got all the stuff an all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things they wore ast em whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story aout o the old chiefwalakea they called him nobody but obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil but the capn cud read folks like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young fellerthough come to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did hear it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the sea an gittin all kinds o favors in return they met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface thats haow the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was all right with the heathens because theyd ben havin a hard time an was desprate abaout everything they give a sarten number o young folks to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks they made what the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an jine the main lot o things daown thar an this is the important part young fellerthem as turned into fish things an went into the water wouldnt never die them things never died excep they was kilt violent wal sir it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water an quittin the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o hundred years or so afore everybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the few as hadnt got none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the island but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of em things went on that way fer years an obed got enough o that goldlike stuff to make him start the refinery in waites old rundaown fullin mill wall come abaout thuttyeightwhen i was seven year oldobed he faound the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the other islanders had got wind o what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they must a had arter all them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the master of a ship genlly profited the crew proportionate most o the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was in bad shape because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too well thens the time obed he begun acursin at the folks fer bein dull sheep an prayin to a christian heaven as didnt help em none he told em hed knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin ye reely need an says ef a good bunch o men ud stand by him he cud mebbe git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them
