felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken

suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing else to do almost dazed by

this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport they told me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were those who said she could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo from boston and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal in september i entered oberlin for my final year and from then till the next june was busy with studies and other wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connection with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the middle of julyjust a year after the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses of blackness and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street reentering the square i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street around the corner of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other

corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying and barking without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were like their father though poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution by the present town square recrossing the gorge on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street was almost its duplicate save that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward

the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses of blackness and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to show it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were those who said she could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic she had changedas those who take to the water soon the sound of the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth spose one night ye seed somethin heavy heaved offen obeds dory beyond the reef an then larned nex day a young feller was missin from home hey did anybody ever see hide or hair o hiram gilman agin did they an nick pierce an luelly waite an adoniram saouthwick an henry garrison hey heh heh wal sir that was the time obed begun to git on his feet agin folks see his three darters awearin goldlike

others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the sea fer that long zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though glancing apprehensively at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent and little by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable but their crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that one figure was strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows

wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
