glistened whitely in the moonlight and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had

course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations

pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at

the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about

the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing that i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the rays of my flashlight i found i could open the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner i walked rapidly softly and close to the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space where eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youths map and seeking a route i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of state for my approach to town square near the corner of fall street i began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers and when i finally reached the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses of blackness and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this

monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my

began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment certain kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose deaths had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the street signs were down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution by the present town square recrossing the gorge on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street was almost its duplicate save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the falls in the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing federal street safely north of the green and entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adams streets following washington street and several were

systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green those churches were very oddall violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution by the present town square recrossing the gorge on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street was almost its duplicate save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the falls in the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing federal street safely north of the green and entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green those churches were very oddall violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream in which i met my grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
