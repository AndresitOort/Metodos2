s remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some

gold here the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of them poor

though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight grandson of captain obed marsh who founded the business his mother seems tove been some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago they always do that about innsmouth people and folks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man and why is everybody so down on innsmouth well young fellow you mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the oldtimers tell about the black reef off the coastdevil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the

formation was interesting and its just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there was talk of his dealing with demons there fact is i guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef that was before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks in innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from china or somewhere by the shipping it surely was bad enoughthere was riots over it and all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape cod well there must be something like that back of the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh was

would have interested me and the agents old manner of allusion roused something like real curiosity so i asked the agent to tell me something about it he was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at

somewhere around cape cod well there must be something like that back of the innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent

reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh heh heh the old man was getting hysterical and i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the rays of my flashlight i found i could open the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner i walked rapidly softly and close to the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space where eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder or out toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the wust zadok was really screaming now and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with them eyesi tell obed marsh hes in hell an hez got to stay thar heh heh in hell i says cant git mei haint done nothin nor told nobody nothin yet im agoin to naow yew jest set still an listen to me boythis is what i aint never told nobody i says i didnt get to do no pryin arter that nightbut i found things aout jest the same yew want to know what the reel horror is hey wal its thisit aint what them fish devils hez done but what theyre agoin to do theyre abringin things up aout o whar they come from into the taownben doin it fer years an slackenin up lately them haouses north o the river betwixt water an main streets is full of emthem devils an what they brungan when they git ready i say when they git ready ever hear tell of a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what them things bei seen em one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette bates adams and banks streetsthe latter skirting the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman house i was glad to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundinline kin tech ol capn obed done ithim that faound aout moren was good fer him in the saouth

naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the master of a ship genlly profited the crew proportionate most o the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was in bad shape because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too well

need an says ef a good bunch o men ud stand by him he cud mebbe git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder or out toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh heh heh the old man was getting hysterical and i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the corner of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette bates adams and banks streetsthe latter skirting the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street to the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to stop over at the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for somethinglistening for something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green those churches were very oddall violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after all but when i gently shook his shoulder he turned on me with astonishing alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases dunt believe me hey heh heh hehthen just tell me young feller why capn obed an twenty odd other folks used to row aout to devil reef in the dead o night an chant things so laoud ye cud hear em all over taown when the wind was right tell me that hey an tell me why obed was allus droppin heavy things daown

watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now and the dirty white beard bristled electrically old zadok probably saw me shrink back for he began to cackle evilly heh heh heh heh beginnin to see

the depths of his beard god what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsinthe folks as was missin an them as kilt theirselvesthem as told things in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time that refinery though used to be a big thing and old man marsh who owns it must be richern croesus queer old duck though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight grandson of captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette bates adams and banks streetsthe latter skirting the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the corner of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundinline kin tech ol capn obed done ithim that faound aout moren was good fer him in the saouth sea islands never was nobody like capn obedold limb o satan heh heh i kin mind him atellin abaout furren parts an callin all the folks stupid fer goin to christian

folkss prayers matt eliot his fust mate talked a lot too only he was agin folkss doin any heathen things told abaout an island east of othaheite whar they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked like the big statues on easter island they was a little volcanic island near thar too whar they was other ruins with diffrent carvinsruins all wore away like theyd ben under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o positions like they was human beins nobody cud git aout o them whar they got all the stuff an all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things they wore ast em whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story aout o the old chiefwalakea they called him nobody but obed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil but the capn cud read folks like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young fellerthough come to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room it was designed to open in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder or out toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech hey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh heh heh the old man was getting hysterical and i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable but their crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that one figure was strangely robed and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar again groping toward the street reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of those very extreme innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did hear it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the sea an gittin all kinds o favors in return they met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface thats haow the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was all right with the heathens because theyd ben havin a hard time an was desprate abaout everything they give a sarten number o young folks to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks they made what the things agreed to give in return was a plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an jine the main lot o things daown thar an this is the important part young fellerthem as turned into fish things an went into the water wouldnt never die them things never died excep they was kilt violent wal sir it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water an quittin the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to take to the water changeand told me she had never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i would never die but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night in a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic she had changedas those who take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things till finally theyd take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal

anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the sea fer that long zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though glancing apprehensively at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him that awful night i seed em i was up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of

this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive
