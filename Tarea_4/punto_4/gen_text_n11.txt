might easily have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must have heard instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported episode i was willin to pay heavy an i guess obed kind o come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man was getting hysterical and i began to hear something and when sober could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must wait once more in shadow i resumed my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long confidential discussion about the irredeemable pollution of the vague sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street safely north of the green and entering the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the town all this to the pious miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments as for the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the door of the gilman house it seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground almost shaking with the unknown seadeeps instead of state for my approach to town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing the gorges brink but at length a firm knock came at my outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to edge around southward into washington lafayette street amidst a cloud of vapor from the next room the door of my room one had been there and seeing what kind of story dont go down with only my coat collar shoes and all in the dark drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to edge around innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought up that which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle walter had not looked like the big statues on easter island they was daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or something about it he was very deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of my pursuers must be strangely robed and unmistakable sound which seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and lobstering everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o hundred years or so afore everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and it soon came to be the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have looked in the old days before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the battering which somehow called up images of the most deserted nightmare which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be recalled at the arkham historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and i turned down paine street around the door of the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the things was scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder tightened everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the wust zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the moonlit open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been through was highly uncertain but now they must die of looking in the same direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed an twenty odd other folks used to row aout to devil reef in the sea an gittin all kinds o positions like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young fellerthem as turned into waite street on my way again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually happened i did not like the ones carved over the abnormally large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth types said to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently impressed the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef that was before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks stupid fer goin to christian meetin an bearin their burdens meek an lowly says theyd orter git better gods like some o the carved knickknacks an harborage in the taown when they wanted to mix like they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess the other case on the north and i knew that the moonlight and i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregational parson aout o taown an the methodist feller quitnever did see resolved babcock the baptist parson aginwrath o jehovyi was a mighty little critter but i heerd what i heerd an seen what i seendagon an ashtorethbelial an beelzebubgolden caff an the idols o canaan an the philistinesbabylonish abominationsmene mene tekel upharsinthe folks as was missin from home hey did anybody ever see hide or hair o hiram gilman agin did they an nick pierce an luelly waite an adoniram saouthwick an henry garrison hey heh heh heh the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the low black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew that this planet has actually spawned such things that lived under the electric light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight i found i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to ship aout to newbryport arkham and in the other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door was now terrific and i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of the sane world of wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous mother was married to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about it he was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole reported nor were any of the questions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to hear something wrong with their alienrhythmed footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached water street at a grade and at once proceeded to check my valise in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the greatest influence on the town but i must try to tell what i thought of this aged witness to the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives did not like the idea of wormy decay and as we approached and at length i reached main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached and at length i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expression of poignantly disagreeable impressions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk would make you laughabout old captain marsh must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the fish blood from them deepwater things when they git ready i say when they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things said them as want never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but hell take to the water and swam a great deal in both river and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder and he made no motion as i turned into fish things from any place in the water changeand told me that there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothing positive ever developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the door of the third oathid a died ruthern take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain greasiness about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything about the fellow increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out then we rolled into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed my last vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible to the sagging uneven buildings i would have free play there there was nothing else some of the fish bloodbein of a royal lines on other islanders they was a party one night in a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the electric bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered and disturbed puerile though glancing apprehensions without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned into fish things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess obed kind o come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old man to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the right one a guess which the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers on the bus somehow i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe i need to wait for the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut a year before from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government officials made a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the time obed begun to git on his feet agin folkss doin any heathen things told the kanakys kind o balked but finally theyd take to the water wouldnt never die them things said them as was born more like their father though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a large projecting catch for the shutters and in another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i chose marsh street instead of terror i do not believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly had the true marsh eyes was obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent many terraces with gardens of strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth the essex county histories on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was all full o fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal line that intermarried with him much of their crouching shambling gait of an average innsmouth people the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth fisheries seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shambling in the darkness and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to be of the same size judging from the grocery youths map since the hour was past guessing it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been something that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done in that brierchoked railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time that refinery though used to be almost a cityquite a port before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the other shapes began to make as soon as they knew must be devil reef were very oddall violently dreading to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old mans whisper grew fainter and i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes it was then that i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconsciously listening for somethin afore they cud take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was all right with the heathens because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too well thens the time obed he begun acursin at the folks on his side an had long talks with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little to say except that the ties which i feared for a moment i simply held my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of battering which somehow called up images of the most decayed and far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost repulsive design as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things till finally they larnt something and when sober could not an hallucination have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire possibly many suggested somethin haowd ye like to be a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em that is i was afeardnever did not come and when i finally reached the square in eliot street reentering the cut i glanced behind me and i presently allowed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouths abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabody said been considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the pillared hall on the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting door i had shielded with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was kilt violent wal sir it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to land on it sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed that the aged tongue did not like the idea of riding alone with the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices in some place near the corner of fall street i began to swarm into the harbor into the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very fond of the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed my last vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible to the sagging uneven buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost perfect duplicate save that there was nothing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly is a strange furtive creature was almost hopping when the last hundred years or so afore everybody awonderin jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the large semicircular square across there was no time to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and the dirty white beard bristled electrically old zadok say that the daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear though what some of the folks on his side an had long talks with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting catch for the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the moon played on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying entities of unknown source whose husband lived in yhanthlei was not destroyed when the vehicle started with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south of me was being tried with a pass key then the lock on my hall door turned off the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be recalled at the arkham historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had been assured that the news of my escape as i opened the windows i heard a frightful dream in which i must land the clatter at the northeast behind me a series of raids and arrests occurred followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches or around the marshes together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed the old man and why is everybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the preachersno usethey run the congregational parson aout o taown an the methodist feller quitnever did see resolved babcock the baptist parson aginwrath o jehovyi was a mighty little critter but i heerd what i heerd an seen what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsinthe folks araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning back to the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government in the distant breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef in the dead o night an chant things so laoud ye cud hear em all over the seaan a few goldlike things they had all kinds o positions like they was human beins nobody cud git aout o them whar they was all full o fish bloodbein of a royal lines on other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or something like that back of the innsmouth people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman had not yet spread the open space where they would rise again for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very close nowthe air foul with their alienrhythmed footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the sides of the cut flattened out and began walking up state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earlier open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlight at the strangeness and frequent hideousness of his intonation even though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change the old man and why is everybody so down on innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family in cleveland household but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i met my grandmother whoever he was and that look in the staringeyed faces of my grandmother and uncle douglas one night in a frightful dream in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque fishes as my companions then the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown railway cut a year before from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to swarm into the harbor fit to kill an heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned my head to look at whatever horror that leering yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface thats haow the kanakys an he fer one didnt feel baound to stop em far gone was obed jest like a crazy man on the subjeck he says the natives araound thar had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder or out toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their alienrhythmed footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was coming to resemble my grandmothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogicaland had planned to go directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than she did but the most baffling thing was the most nauseous fishy odor again waxed dominant there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently using the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence i felt was seeking gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous abnormality i never heard of shadowed innsmouth shadow which had caused him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made at once mad and pitiful grotesque fishes as my companions then the other islands walakea give him hey boy the watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now and the marketing of gold ingots formed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the safest course was ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earliest civic center displaced after the civil war time when children born senct fortysix begun to git on his feet agin folkss doin any heathen things told abaout an island east of it were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington from the north as they reached the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square near the waterfront i thought of but the worst of all innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and when i finally reached the opposite end i saw the ancient railway and i now saw that the ties were safe for at least no pursuer the ancient toper had muttered a few indistinguish nothing in detail but i did my best and on the roof of the paine street and turned southward i glanced back at the sea but there was no time to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the few as hadnt got none of these unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought i saw a sardonic she had changedas those who take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while come in fortysix the taown when the wind was right tell me that hey an tell me why obed was allus droppin heavy things daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices an savage knickknacks they made what the trouble was but it was probably from him that some of them had tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar again groping toward the unknown seadeeps instead of state for my approach to town square near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain had transferred him there and when i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the trackand i could open the shutters and in another instant everything alive come aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things so laoud ye cud hear em all over the ruins on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems these kanakys was sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story is that there were those who had lived in a phosphorescent many terraces with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really unconsciously listening for something hideous lay in the background my father would probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was something about the street door was wide open but there was a curiously innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly is a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder or out toward the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same yew want to know what them things bei seen em one night as follered obeds craowd aout to the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lowern ye kin saound tell me why obed was allus droppin heavy things daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices an savage knickknacks an harborage in the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too many folks missintoo much wild preachin at meetin of a sundaytoo much talk abaout that reef i guess i done a bit by tellin selectman mowry what i see from the confused extravagance he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all but when i gently shook his shoulder or out toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother and uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming in now and tears were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the deep water tother side o the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lowern ye kin saound tell me what he done with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached and at length the decrepit vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and the road crossed the trackand i could open the shutters on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers on the bus somehow i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant creatures stared cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost savage and maniacal now and the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the reef and despite the states safety regulations there was something about it he was very deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling station on my left and noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and catch would be likely to be native to innsmouth shadow which had caused him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at last beginning to share his vague apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder or out toward the room north of me and perceived that one figure was strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and had my right knee and shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost savage and maniacal now and the dirty white beard bristled electrically old zadok probably some foreign kind of disease brought from some innsmouth well young fellerthem as turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted nightmare and some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches or around the door of my room one had been something like that they were he said of very grotesque and almost terrifying the ground almost shaking with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the strange jewelry said to be hidden in crumbling station on the edge of the river betwixt water an main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which made me uneasy it was as if the bus were about to concentrate against the one and a bureau against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i could read my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed largely to cooperate with the kanakys got wind they was daown thar an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was a party one night as follered obeds craowd aout to the reef and despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have free play there there was nothing there and hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouths abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral quest in new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south side of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place some was more teched than others an some never did quite figure out what the things alive in the stone buildins when the island till they was past seventy though the people hereabouts it goes through innsmouth that night nor was there any other way of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment i simply held my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the taownben doin it fer years an slackenin up lately them haouses north o the river gorgeto the abandoned railway cut a year before from that day on my life has been a nightmare and some of the figures i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water onct an only needs a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing what kind of story dont go down with only my coat collar shoes and all in the band of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that had collapsed pervading everything they give a sarten number o young folks to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or something it had not suggested somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible to the sagging uneven buildings in paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something which i dreaded but could not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water tother side o the reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the fire station on the edge of the river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef then showing plainly and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was really screaming now and the mad frenzy of his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o them whar they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no pryin arter that awful night i seed em i was up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of themand certainly not english their features were indistinguishable but their crouching shambling in the darkness every faint noise of the night train to arkham no it could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading the fall of night in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a block for at my left i began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching inland i saw that the weak panelling was beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder he turned on me with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys got wind they was all full o fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with him much of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously at their evil seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things agreed to give my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was coming to resemble my grandmother but perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expression of all was borne in upon methe impression of poignantly disagreeable impression of poignantly disagreeable impressions connected with the bedstead however still held firm so that i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the waves seemed to be unusual activity in the town all this to the pious miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new england for more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole countryside beyond at the end of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolted condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost hopping when the last hundred years or so afore everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there were occasional official visits from government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the thing which i dreaded but could not escape it i would never be destroyed even though i knew the searchers would have interested me and in this fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman had not yet spread the open space before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and had my right knee and shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was a strain of morbidity there and when i finally reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the street door was wide open but there was no time to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw shutwas certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the streets end far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok say that the daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly is a strange kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral at times i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagance he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not answer so i knew that much of my route must be visible from the cupalo hordes of em swarms of themand certainly not english their features were indistinguishable but their crouching gait one man moved in a positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously at their evil seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was a little volcanic island near thar too whar they might be able to see them but they could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested something subtler and more puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother and uncle douglas had always depressed me there was something which would help them but now they must a had arter all them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only thing to do was to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head bulging watery unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly is a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something which i dreaded but could not help beginning to share his vague apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness my greatgreatgrandmother had never liked him either something as put a new face on the main streets is full of emthem devils an what they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though they had white bellies they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they brungan when they git ready ever hear tell of a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what them fish devils hez done but what the things alive in the stone buildins when the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the others was satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too many folks missintoo much wild preachin at meetin of a sundaytoo much talk abaout that reef i guess i done a bit by tellin selectman mowry an see what he cud do maounds o the dead an the dyin shots an screams shaoutin in ol squar an taown squar an new church green jail throwed open proclamation treason called it the plague when folks come in an faound haff our people missin nobody left but them as ud jine in with obed an thuttytwo others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the large semicircular square across the moonlight and i thought of this aged witness to the towns salient features after a moment there came that soft damnably unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar again groping toward the sea between crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the gorges brink but at length feeling a fatigue which had caused his wandering and take the nearest corner into bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did hear it seems by the time obed he begun acursin at the folks in the injiesgods as ud bring em good fishin in return they met the things they was a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something it had not suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly not english their features were indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been there and seeing others with the weedy length of the oldtimers tell about the street to the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expressionless face he had a narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was none the less bewildered tour of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the greatest influence i felt was seeking gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could get out the window i had hoped to reach the ancient toper had muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the party be still advancing along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance the line kept on along the sound of my efforts at economy and made at once mad and pitiful grotesque and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared there and my mother and uncle douglas one night when the tide was right maybe he did for i dare say the rock formation was interesting of all was a glancing reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like their father though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter had not looked like that back of the innsmouth either to arkham whence my mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the look in his watery blue eyes were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable discussions and made a suggestion which made me uneasy it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether that of mirth spose one night as follered obeds craowd aout to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouthand accordingly i began to use my flashlight and was almost its duplicate of the one miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and the mad frenzy of his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things as nobodyd never see one othemclost to in all my life that is never no fullblooded one barnabas marsh that runs the refinry chimbly other folks was prosprin toofish began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at them as they passed on across the open space where they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst shock came when my uncle was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across the river gorgeto the abandoned waterfront i thought of this aged witness to the towns salient features after a moment i simply held my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was nothing that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street and looked along it toward the west the horde was very deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of arrests the abnormality i never heard of innsmouth it had evidently given to working or lounging around but not crossing as before in the shabby hotel lobby there was one box of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a large projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the unknown seadeeps instead of terror of my own ancestral quest in new england for more than i could remember but even what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman and i have carried away impressions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the kanakys kind o balked but finally the connecting door and again a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait of an average innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something which had probably find my way about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would surge by and had curious thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible from my imagination had supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold ornaments might easily be looking and possible eliot street as broad as south i crossed the trackand i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted shelter i once more for bringing the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed even though i knew the searchers would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the distant reef my muscles tightened everything was the most nauseous fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shambling figures crossed my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making good my escape from that canton madhouse and together with the other islanders they was a little volcanic island near thar too whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things they wore ast em whar they got all the stuff an all the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching gait one man moved in a positively starting from his head was almost its duplicate of the one miss tilton formed an excellent time made from newburyport still fresh they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they brungan when they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things bei seen em one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the designs there were limitless streamflopping hopping croaking baying entities of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not expect it either for i thought too of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was the queer ruins an it seems these kanakys was sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room north of me and perceived that one figure was so odd that it sent a chill through the spectral summer moonlight and i saw that the typical shamble of the innsmouth next time they had quite a few mills but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material in existence there and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not wish to give up his job there was a large projecting catch for the shutters and in another instant everything alive come aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things they had all kinds o positions like they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the first i ever heard of innsmouth any references regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did remember each morning would be enough to take to the water changeand told me she had never see one othemclost to in all my life that is never no fullblooded one

rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized the bolt held of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth i paused and drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the rooms on both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see the blue water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef then showing plainly and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming in now

this hoary character zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i must land the clatter at the northeast behind me momentarily increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder as if afraid of something it had not suggested something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouth for my contact with this driver but as the leaving time obviously the besiegers had brought up that which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of how they must befor was not the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place always was badly cut off from the grocery boys map that the back of his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned into waite street on my way again and again a receding creaking this time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room north of me and perceived that the room to the south of me was being tried with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead against old captain obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather though for orne material in existence there and engulfed all the houses were apparently using the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the creature who constantly looked over his shoulder or out toward the river gorgeto the abandoned railway bridge the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and toppling steeples loomed up to the northeast behind me momentarily increased my dislike he was evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be repaired that nightbut i found things aout jest the same moment a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the townsfolk would not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers aint welcome around innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the master of a ship genlly profited the crew proportion of them poor mattmatt he allus was agin ittried to line up the folks on his side an had long talks with the preachersno usethey run the congregational parson aout o taown

room was softly tried the bolted connection i succeeded in bolting the northeast behind me forever the morbid and horrors which could be nothing but the bizarre object which glistened whitely in the moonlight and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the ridgepole of the block below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from the north as they reached the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling creatures stared cryptical flashing of those nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked at him i saw that theres a whole legion of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not even guess i was sorry but i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes check them for the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the likeness of my eyes to captain obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the most baffling thing was the most nauseous fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching gait one man moved in a positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was no time to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the third oathid a died ruthern take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain greasiness about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from evilshadowed innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up to the northeast behind me forever the morbid and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to concentration camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the kanakys an he fer one didnt feel baound to stop em far gone was obed jest like they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to stay thar heh heh in hell i says cant git mei haint done nothin nor told nobody nothin oh you young fellerthough come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old mans whisper grew fainter and i was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there were limitless swarms of themand certainly had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space bound outward along eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok probably some foreign kind of disease brought from some innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the irredeemable pollution of the government inquiry and action brought on the distant reef my muscles tightened everything cleaned up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of em all over the reef and the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most detestable sort and the bus could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with the governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham and it was said that she had wandered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouth the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed when the vehicle started with a warmth that may have been bought from some innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight so that there was talk of his dealing with demons there fact is i guess on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line passed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead against itlittle by little it seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door of my room one had been spied glancing apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder against a hall door was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible in the winter of 192728 federal government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel lobby where the line passed through my transom and the boards of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient massachusetts seaport of innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible legends and i had never die them things or else keep quiet never heerd o my pa no more the old man was getting hysterical and i began to use my flashlight i found i could distinguishable but their crouching shapes loping and shambling in the darkness every faint noise of the night having crossed to the window i had hoped to reach the ancient toper had muttered a few indistinguish nothing in detail but i did my best and on the roof of the paine street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment certain kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose deaths had been not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distance the line kept on along the corridor there came another soft rattling and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the north and in the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southern side at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion and alienation i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the battering which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of riding alone with this affair has been closer than that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister bus it was then that i began to hear somethinglistening for something was coming to resemble my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable quality the bus had already gone and studied them the more i studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain had transferred him there and my mother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business his mothers death two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not quite crossed the trackand i could open the shutters and in another inhuman and bloodcurdling scream eyaaahhhh yhaaaaaaaa before i chose marsh street instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing antiquarian and genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and scabby and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of his voice disturbed me more than she did but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking firemen this of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler had realized that he had begun to grow upsome of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never closed at the sides of the rooms on both sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their skin aint quite right rough and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was all the more maddening because not one of my pursuers that flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and the bus could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had gained force there and he did not answer so i knew i would have interested me and in this fascination and to make matters worse there now but the real thing behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along the sound of waterfalls became more and more desolate salt marshes around my watch if i woke up later in the darkness every faint noise of the night train to arkham and i began to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square i saw that the townsfolk would not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers aint welcome around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with this driver but as the leaving time obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous load muffled sounds of possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north entered with a pass key then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that this must be the joe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and seeing others with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers ef we knowed what was good fer us we all hed to take the oath o dagon an later on they was some of the third oaths that some of the old mans whisper grew fainter and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth people they sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the salem man that came

good bit over a mile out and toward the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from my mysterious greatgrandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable quality the bus had come to call the innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the compact part of the town all this to the pious miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street made a turn and drew up on the righthand side in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced first at the connecting rooms and these i proceeded out the window and on the whole it was really unconsciously listening for somethinglistening for something less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the pillared order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when children born senct fortysix begun to grow upsome of em that is i was afeardnever did no pryin arter that night under the sea onct an with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was only at the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself at times almost unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all but when i gently shook his shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait i had assumed to this day despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something apart from the island but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things so laoud ye cud hear em all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them wearing their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were mostly shiny and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch the steady note of a waterfall through mefor it seemed as if many bulging watery blue eyes that never seem to shut and bolt the open connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not expect it either for i thought of but the worst of all innsmouth i paused and drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have looked in the old days before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching gait one man moved in a positively starting from his head was almost its duplicate of the one miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obeds in arkham by collecting some genealogical data with the various notes and lists of book references to decline were few though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested beforesomething which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused his wandering gaze to light on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the stories would make the price easy for me but there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness those farthest south seeming the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the vague noises underfoot had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother had never liked him either something and when sober could not possibly be arranged the library shelves had very little of her father when he came to toledo from boston and later a minor factory center using the queerest kind of part time that refinery though used to be almost a cityquite a port before the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity so i asked the agents old manner of allusion roused somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from evilshadowed innsmouth shadow which had been her grandmother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo from boston and later a minor factory center using the queerest kind of part time that refinery though used to be almost a cityquite a port before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was the queer ruins an it seems these kanakys was sacrifices in some place near the waterfront i thought of those very extreme innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible legends and i had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like the big statues on easter island they was daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was gave away an forced to give up his job there was a large projecting catch for the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must open directly on me outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that my windows commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast barnlike length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting catch for the shutters on the bus somehow i did not expect it either for i thought of how they must wait once more consulted the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall and down the stairs so i knew that a long section of the government man thats disappeared there and hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth at length a firm knock came at my outer door by pushing the bureau against the feeble connecting door bracing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham people and folks here and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must die of looking in the dark drowsiness in it i bolted the newly opened connection with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the ruinous green still gazing toward the malodorous sea were positively simian way with long confidential discussions and made a suggestion that none of these unpleasant creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the deserted streets of innsmouth in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government men in connection i succeeded i was glad to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently impressed the whole reported nor were any of the questions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth harbor but at last i saw the close moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during the winter of 192728 federal government in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth people and in time he dropped out of sight i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was none the less bewildered tour of innsmouths

newlypurchased bottle and soon realized the bolt held of course my resolution to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not think i grieved when i knew that the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the compact part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost savage and maniacal now and the sound of the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned on me with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was a lot o stone ruins

the grocery youths map and seeking a route i cautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconsciously listening for something which i dreaded but could not be heavy this was to be my realm tooi could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to shut my eyes it was then that the most baffling thing was the most nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of these faces now suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious number of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not an hallucination have been sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was

i thought of those very extreme innsmouth but the chain grocery whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose frightened appeals for government after my frantic running ceased before i could

maternal uncle of mine had been something was coming along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever he had glimpsed there was a large projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from onctia ia cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i

impression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased the open space where i had checked my valise in the fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less bewildered and disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses that stared blankly into the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course and i heard the battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of waterfalls became more and more hateful as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but hell take to the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things liked human sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the water promised tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the newly outfitted hall door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked at him i saw that the room after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives made it unsafe to be seen questioning him it was probably find my way about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh driving bargains with the weedy length of the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensively at my watch was still going and told me she had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my case there was no remaining trace of zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouths ruined roofs and leaning houses sometimes on four i was somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered about the streets end far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened in a corner cupboard under the sea an gittin all kinds o positions like they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking went along the gorges brink but at length a firm knock came at my outer door by pushing the bureau against the other shapes began to

kanakys it took obed to git the truth aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the weedy length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight at the street door was wide open but there was no time to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the third roomthe one from whose window i could least audibly manage it when i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the muddy road to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and we presently allowed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches or around the fish docks and carried with him much of their crouching shapes loping and shambling figures crossed my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making good my escape as i opened the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public harm save a shock of repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression of both of them had given place to a fresh and uncertain bridge now before me and i seemed to change that want a bit horrible arter a while come in fortysix the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water whar they got all

one must not for example linger much around the corner into lafayettethere edging around the corner of fall street i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was just a chance that the fumbling might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the cupalo they was a lot o stone ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses

goldlike things they had all kinds o favors in return fer their sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time able to walk so started slowly along the abandoned railway bridge beyond which a large square opened out before me was not only unlocked but actually happened i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe me hey heh heh heh beginnin to see hey haow abaout the night train to arkham and in the other and moving a washstand in front of me but was soon on my way again and from then till the next june was busy with studies and other wholesome life into unnameable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were

dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments doubtless introduced since the hour was past guessing it seemed to notice it too for he began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at me curiously innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgreatgrandmother had

never to wink a flat nose a receding creaking this time the cautious rattling ceased before i chose marsh street instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussion about the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the significance of the later record was unmistakable sound which seemed wholly devoid of wires here and he did not wish to give up his job there was

eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying and barking without the least fraction in another instant everything was the inability of anyone to place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north and in the other door as i gained this respite i heard the floor creak as the prowler had realized the bolted condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible in babson street toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a curiously innsmouth people and folks here and hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor imaginable abysses of blackness and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearanceespecially those staring unwinking eyes which one never saw the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then turning inland i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and the next door to the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch any articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression of all was borne in upon methe impression of all was borne in upon methe impressions connected chart i could construct i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgrandmother and selfslain uncle might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing an open space bound outward along eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the lobby and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of the water an jine the main lot o things daown into the deep water an never come up haowd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh heh heh the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the marks as the one formerly on the door of the things till finally i was forced to give my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was coming along the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the government officials made a strange and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother whoever he was and that look in the staring unwinking expressionless face he had a narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding creaking this time the cautious rattling ceased before i could read my watch was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the other and moving a washstand in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house which loomed up grayly toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral moonlight in a grotesque and terrifying the grocery youths map since the ancestry of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government man thats disappeared there and seeing others with the traces of an old railway bridge beyond up the gorge on the matter seems that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless swarms of em all over taown when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or something which would help them but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful influence on the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fish docks and carried with royal lines on other islanders somewhere by the shipping it surely was bad enoughthere was riots over it and all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind of story dont go down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth people and in time he dropped out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the fire station there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that the rings in the shutters and in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new england for more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally theyd take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things told the kanakys an he fer one didnt feel baound to stop em far gone was obed jest like the ones carved over the ruins of wharves jutted out from the immediate problem was how to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete the journey to arkham before these pursuers came down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever he had glimpsed there was a curiously innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the window and down the stairs so i knew i would have found nothing whatever horror that leering yellow

little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham and i began to swarm into the taownben doin it fer years an slackenin up lately them haouses north o the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing what kind of a streak in the innsmouth it had evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of captain obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgreatgrandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable quality the bus had come to call the innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been there many years before my grandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgreatgrandmother and uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the moonlit waters between the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the

upon the degenerate creatures stared cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically out of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strain of morbidity there and seeing others with the traces of life reappeared furtive shambling gait i had assumed to this day despite the excellent shape water street and looked along it toward the southerly room and were massing in a lateral

made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have free play there there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall doors of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth well young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody i says i didnt get to do no pryin arter that night nor was there any other layman and i have carried away impression of poignantly disagreeable impression which could be nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the street reentering the square i saw that the rowley road drew so close to the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was he said no public harm save a shock of repulsion and oddly enough i found things aout jest the same yew want to know what them fish devils hez done but what the trouble was but it was all right with the queer otherworldly quality of their faces and the roar of the falls in the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before these pursuers came down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the towns salient features after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the typical expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that never closed at the sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folk as best i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and close to the old railway before crossing an open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlight the gait of this figure was strangely robed and unmistakable sound which seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the gilmans and the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose deaths had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the puzzling in the rays of my flashlight and was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow moon might have time to collate and codify them the curator had told me i had acquired the innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and when i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether too familiar again groping toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and i thought of those very extreme innsmouth but i could probably from him that some of the williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and lobstering everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago more empty houses that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on the leanest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business his mother seems tove been some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody awonderin jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the sea fer that long zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though they had white bellies they were very common and everyone in sight seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant conjectures crossed in front of me not much more than she did but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible from my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral at times i fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted and there the ruins on the little islet with the heathens because theyd ben havin a hard time an was desprate abaout everything was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the sea between crumbling houses sometimes on two legs and sometimes on two legs and sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they hankered arter nothin was to be my realm tooi could not complete the journey to arkham whence my mothers family in cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried as best i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and corridor there came another soft rattling and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the north there was a strange furtive creature was almost reluctant to produce they were the blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical flashing of those nameless designliving and horrible croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not name at length i reached main street i clung as closely as possible from my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh by a monstrous mother was another o them as was nearly human sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were he said of very grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth who were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other sidei knew must be devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the ancestry of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government man thats disappeared i was eight years old and somewhat touched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though they had white bellies they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the room to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the north and in the distance crouched in the bushes of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the streets end far out beyond the reef an then larned nex day a young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody i says i didnt get to do no pryin arter that awful night i seed em i was up in the morninbut they was the kind o critters as got all the stuff an all the other case on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did remember but even what i did remember but even what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something which i dreaded but could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady note of a waterfall through mefor it seemed to me the creature who constantly looked over his shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally they larnt something as put a new face on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the buildings in paine street around the corner of the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was then that the most baffling thing was the most nauseous fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have heard about thatand so the people hereabouts it goes through innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new englandthe same trip no doubt which had gained force there and seeing what kind of a streak in the innsmouth that nightbut i found this overtone more disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing westward and diverging something like real curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now but the real thing behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father benjamin orne just after the civil war time when innsmouth folk as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous load muffled sounds of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to get out of that bus and at once veered off in grief after the innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen it seemed tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible vocal origin approached along the abandoned railway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings to washington at the intersection of south though i had never liked him either something as put a new face on the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have heard instantly the outside knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northwest from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably been a major cause of his mother was married to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient tippler meanwhile walking rapidly through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost exact duplicate save that there would be to avoid paine since the order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the other natives wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and alienation i could think of before i reached water street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment certain kinsfolk whose personnel was not likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the window and on the roof of the paine street around the ruined houses at bates street when i heard a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange jewelry said to be hidden in crumbling houses toward the street i had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was somehow glad that they had no more than she did but the most horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was probably from him that some of us took them as ud jine in with obed an thuttytwo others was in jail with everything cleaned up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of em all over taown when the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new england ships used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the ruinous green still gazing toward the town my frantic running ceased and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room to the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people the place always was badly cut off from the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me and i presently drew very near the beach as our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the line passed through a trick what was it the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgreatgrandfather though poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean walls and grotesque fishes as my companions then the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the lonely crest ahead where the manuxet god what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsin he stopped again and from the other and moving a washstand in front of me but was soon on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance was great and i could open the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw the rusted grassgrown opening toward the courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching inland crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers could not help beginning my attempt i lunged again and again a receding creaking this time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the battering at the two other door as i gained this respite i heard the floor creak as the prowler had realized that he did not wish to give up his job there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently disavowed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins on the little islet with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have heard about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had been spied glancing apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the gilman house which loomed up to the northerly hall door before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical sky the smell of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight the gait of this figure was strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentousness of their crouching shambling gait of an average innsmouth fisheries seemed to expect some demonstration when the very next islands had lean pickins matt he got to wonderin too an so did capn obed an twenty odd other folks used to row aout to devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly shambling gait i had assumed to this day despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not escape it i would never be destroyed the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef in the sea an gittin all kinds o positions like they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to stay thar heh heh in hell i says cant git mei haint done nothin nor told nobody nothin oh you young fellow you mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started but once they do get started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space where they would perhaps be the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of them had tall tiara he wore an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the earliest civic center displaced after the suicide of my uncle douglas her eldest son he had shot himself after a trip to new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to spread and had brought up that which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon the door of the third oathid a died ruthern take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouths ruined roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached i conquered my qualms and followed by the deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said ud bring up the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout o lead or something it had not suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear though what some of us took them as ud jine in with obed an the folks as was missin an them as kilt theirselvesthem as told things an went into the water wouldnt never die but go back to the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose deaths had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent shape water street and turned southward battering which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was almost reluctant to produce they were mostly shiny and slipped it into his pocket then beginning my attempt i lunged again and from the town square recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily be looking and possible eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor again waxed dominant there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had never die but go back to the mother hydra an father dagon what we all come from panton vermont and that kind guess they must wait once more consulted the grocery youths map since the moonlight at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the things on the library shelves had very little of her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother but perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their skin aint quite right rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had been warned that the news of my escape as i opened the window i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the level ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not at first understand the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the rings and catch would be likely to be native to innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moon might have to show it was then that i began to study the mirror definitely told me i could have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning my attempt i lunged again and from the look in his watery blue eyes i feared he was close to a stupor after all but when i gently shook his shoulder or out toward the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable words to the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had not quite crossed the street i had come to a sort of island of higher ground where the sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of the vague noises underfoot had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth or about some kind of caves near the wharves that people around here say theyre hard to get started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or out toward the west the horde was very difficult but i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabody said been considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the corner of fall street i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly from ancient newburyport still fresh they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that this must be the joe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically out of innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of the town square at eightso i tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible from the general tension i busied myself in routine as deeply as possible i would use it if not i would have told more than i could remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful dream in which i saw a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what the reel horror is hey wal its thisit aint what them things or else keep quiet never heerd o my pa no more than a hundred yards away i would be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the others was in jail with everybody so down on innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single word innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought up that which had probably saw me shrink back for he began looking at the newburyport still fresh they were not unfamiliar to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were those who said she could have shown only the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door before me was not only unlocked but actually happened i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe ef they did hear it seems them awful picters o these things mebbe they was human beins nobody cud git aout o here git aout o the water promised tolerable seats and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened whitely in the moonlit water i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though glancing apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness my greatgrandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and seeing what kind of a streak in the innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moon might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had been warned that the natives did not like him to work in innsmouth folk as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of devils seen sometimes on two legs and sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the place always was badly cut off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow course began to cackle evilly heh heh heh heh hehthen just tell me young feller why capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the folks araound thar had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing fascinatedly at the distant reef my muscles tightened everything they give a sarten number o young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of the third oaths that some of us took them as ud help special ud git special rewardsgold an sech no use balkin fer they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the water yet carrying a suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal origin approached and at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the roar of the falls in the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland i saw that night under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the deep water tother side o the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lowern ye kin saound tell me why obed was allus droppin heavy things daown thar made signtalk as soon as they knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings of state street and descend successfully to the ground floor the desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain greasiness about the likeness of my eyes to captain obeds in arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry when i saw that the ties which i feared for a moment i simply held my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentration camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government after my frantic running ceased before i had covered a bolt on the door of the things on the southand my mind instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering it open the knocking became a violent battering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and the bus could not identify once more consulted the grocery boys map that the back of his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was just a chance that the safest course was ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earliest civic center displaced after the civil war time when children born senct fortysix begun to grow upsome of em that is i was afeardnever did no pryin arter that night they rattled our door but pa wouldnt open then he clumb aout the kitchen winder with his musket to find selectman mowry what i seen senct i was fifteen year oldmene mene tekel upharsin he stopped again and from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish to give upan i guess the other case on the southand my mind instantly the outside knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry but i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was then that the moonlight the gait of this figure was strangely robed and unmistakable after the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for something it had not suggested something was coming to resemble my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the civil war since the moonlight and i thought of those very extreme innsmouth it had evidently given to working or lounging around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned down paine street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment in case of peril i knew that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the regular jails of the nation there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northwest from the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i had been a marsh of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that much of my route must be visible from my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling figures crossed in front of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first time and the agents old manner of allusion roused somethin haowd ye like to be a little in order to edge around innsmouth people and in time he dropped out of sight so that there were only three passengers somewhat relieved when i knew that much of my route must be visible from the connecting door bracing myself for the ordeal someone might easily be looking and possible eliot street reentering the cut i glanced behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be neither checked nor explained he was a strain of morbidity there and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was coming in now and tears were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundinline kin tech ol capn obed an twenty odd other folks was prosprin toofish began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder

was shaking me and i turned down paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something and when sober could not an hallucination there were those who take to the water soon the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes together with the other sidei knew must open directly on me outside the heavy folds reached fully to the ground floor the desolation and covered railway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and we presently allowed the old yeller devil but the capn cud read folks like they was human beins nobody cud git aout o them whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story is that there would be no other passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the upperearth men shot death into the sea fer that long zadok was showing signs of fright and exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost exact duplicate of his grandmother but perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of their crouching shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified by the bestial abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still going and told me that the southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted region i could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor of my environment seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls and grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent reason for going ahead to babson street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o here git aout o here they seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naowrun fer itquickaout o this taown another heavy wave dashed against the one and a bureau against the one and a bureau against the one and a bureau against the feeble connecting door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the river gorge there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to be of the same size judging from the gilman house it seemed to be unusual activity in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government officials made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient toper had muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver that i had been warned that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and corridor toward the malodorous sea were positively simian way with long confidential discussion about the marriage of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange old pieces descended from a pole

left town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened whitely in the moonlit water i could see only the incoming tide was now very insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth was carried off they never did change quite enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful scurrying along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my case there was just a chance that the hour was past noon the reality left me none the less bewildered tour of innsmouth but i could probably extract with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached and at length i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the ruins on the little islet with the heathens because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too well thens the time obed begun to grow upsome of em that is i was afeardnever did not come and when i finally reached the opposite end i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible means of avoiding the dangerous to me on the grocery boys map that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow moon might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed to me that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the city along the now descending road i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night train to arkham no it could not look for that piece of strange leprous corals and grotesque and terrifying to me and i do not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted and there the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole it was really forming words and i could distinguishable but their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long confidential discussion about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe finding it but there was one box of strange jewelry said to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently given to working or lounging around but not crossing as before in the shabby hotel lobby where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road drew so close to the old railway station and covered railway cut a year before from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment in case of peril i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the north rim of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have interested me and the sides of the cut flattened out and the roar of the falls in the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing federal street safely north of the green and entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible williamson records and traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and my mother had seemed strange and almost terrifying the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch

this taown another heavy wave dashed against the other and moving a washstand in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road the marsh refinery which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard but stopped short when close to the old railway bridge the vast barnlike length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the high fare that i learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what them fish devils hez done but what the trouble was but it was probably from him that some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough to pilot me into the closed building she assured me that the fumbling might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the corner of fall street i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness of my eyes to captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent and little by little in sargent if you take his bus some of em that is i was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o fish

bulging watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now and the dirty white beard bristled electrically old zadok probably some foreign kind of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was a large projecting catch for the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner i walked rapidly softly and close to the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore to end in indeterminate face and robed shambling in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be a city greater than innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o favors in return fer their sacrifices to the seathings twict every

got all the mermaids stories an sech started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouth next time they had quite a few mills but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole reported episode i was willin to pay heavy an i guess obed kind o come to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall and down the stairs so i knew i would have to cross that dark rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found things aout jest the same yew want to know what them things never died instead she had gone back after obed marsh by a monstrous truth but could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the price easy for me but there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street safely north of the long line of breakers but now zadok was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the curator had told me i had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the safest course was ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space where eliot street stragglers of the party guarding the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads the number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street when i heard a frightful scurrying along the gorges brink but at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along the gorges brink but at length feeling a fatigue which had so darkly colored my imagination another thing that he said innsmouths ruined roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of riding alone with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows i heard a muttering band advancing along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the end only one papera tabloid always disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible but i doubt if he expected quite what actually ajar in a second i was through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago they always do that about innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious mind despite the states safety regulations there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and lobstering everybody awonderin jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be hidden in crumbling station on the edge of the river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef in the dead o night an chant things so cheap it ud pay him to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map that the back of his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously at their evil seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern anybody knew anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked like the big statues on easter island they was daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this with everything they give a sarten number o young folks to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks they made what the trouble was but it was probably saw me shrink back for he began to climb steeply and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that lived under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course and i heard the battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently allowed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of the time and never much below it but at that you could take that it got wuss araound civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refinery which seemed wholly devoid of wires here and hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgreatgrandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland checking some of my new genealogicaland had planned to spread and had brought up that which had nothing of drowsiness however did not come and when i staggered out to the reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef when i spoke to him he did not loosen as quickly as possible means of avoiding the dangerous to me on the grocery boys map with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earliest civic center displaced after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refinery or around any of the questions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to hear somethinglistening for something about it he was very difficult but i did not like the idea of riding alone with the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children shud never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned at considerable discussion about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that the typical shamble of the innsmouth i paused and drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island they was a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing federal street safely north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he did not answer so i knew i would have told more than a little for mention was made of specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear though what some of us took them as ud help special ud git special rewardsgold an sech no use balkin fer they was millions of em daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got old an begun to ship aout to newbryport arkham and in the other shapes began to acquire a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagant outpouring i would probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the street reentering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces with gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother had never liked him either something that disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified by the bestial abnormality i never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably saw me shrink back for he began looking at me curiously disturbing than the primary impression which could have shown only the least suspicion of it it was a living objectthe first except the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had mr peabodys suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the hall all i could think of before i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether that of mirth spose one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must befor was not the memory of that evening at the newburyport and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i had at least a few feet within entering i began to swarm into the harbor fit to kill an heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned my head to look at them as they passed i saw the tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings in paine street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth spose one night ye seed something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouth well its a queer kinds of people they sometimes at night and especially during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard on the right one a guess which the marshes began to acquire a kind of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically out of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the gorge on the matter seems that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw the tumbledown fire station on the edge of the river gorge there was nothing there and when i reached the broad open space was as i had expected at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight at the street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible from my imagination had supplied the touch of bizarre horror was something like real curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth well its a queer kinds of people the place and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and take the nearest corner into lafayettethere edging around the ruined houses at bates street when i heard a frightful scurrying along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the display room of the newburyport still fresh they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that the streets end far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok probably shut me up in a sanitarium at canton i had not quite crossed the street i opened a door off the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the windows i heard a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the mocking yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface thats haow the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children shud never died excep they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water an quittin the place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the cupalo hordes of em swarms of em all over taown when the wind was right maybe he did for i dare say the rock formation was interesting and its just barely possible in babson street then west to lafayette street and looked along it toward the southern side at last i saw the ancient toper had muttered about the staring unwinking eyes which one never saw the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was past minding such impression which destroyed my last vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the faithfulorder o dagonan the children shud never die them things bei seen em one night ye seed something which i dreaded but could not help beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to the buildings in paine street around the pillared hall on the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the thing which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly opened connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have brought home some odd specimens in the museum of miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham too the curator had told me i had acquired the innsmouth or about some kind o godthings that lived under the electric light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight on the low distant line of devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant conjectures crossed in front of it talking with him yet the thought of how they must have deceived them for they passed i saw the close moonlit space where eliot street two of the figures turned to look in my direction and knew that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door which they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have looked in the old days before these pursuers came down the parallel street then west to lafayettethere edging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not be heavy this was the dream in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight on the low distant line of devil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island they was a party one night ye seed somethin heavy heaved offen obed so was pertected unlessen a jury of em proved i told things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess obed kind o come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw shutwas certainly my momentary glimpse could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives anything about the street door was wide open but there was one box of strange leprous corals and grotesque and terrifying to me and i do not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more for bringing the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was to be my realm tooi could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing westward and diverging something which i dreaded but could not at first understand the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with astonishing alertness and snapped out some hints that could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel where i had checked my valise and followed by their respective denominations elsewhere sargent was sorry when i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery unwinking eyes which one never saw the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder as if afraid of something or other had caused his wandering and the noises behind me forever the morbid and horrors which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps this was all madness those farthest south seeming the most detestable sort and the bus could not look for that piece of strange leprous corals i met also that there were occasional official visits from government in the display room of the newburyport and the bus could not help beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the things they wore ast em whar they got all the stuff an all the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the hotel and i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street toward the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the fire station there might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the level ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street reeling northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette and adamsand east of othaheite whar they got all the stuff an all the other shapes began to acquire a kind of exaltation instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth either to arkham whence my mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the look in his watery blue eyes that never seem to shut and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the black and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouth one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the high fare that i learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be diffrunt on the aoutside only we was to keep shy o strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing alertness and snapped out some hints that could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that the southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that desolate railway cut and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was coming to resemble my grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly is a strange furtive creature was almost hopping when the last hundred years or so afore everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham too the curator had told me i had acquired the innsmouth in the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination the later record was unmistakable sound which seemed wholly devoid of wires here and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northwest from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done in that brierchoked railway before crossing westward and diverging something it had not suggested she was the natural daughter of obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather though poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have to stop over at the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could think of before i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the line passed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted region i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time able to walk so started slowly along the hall and down the stairs so i knew i would have free play there there was a curiously innsmouth for my contact with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably find my way about the street signs were down the parallel street then west to lafayette and adamsand east of othaheite whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story is that there was no fire escape on this side of the room it was designed to open in my direction and knew that this must be the party be still advancing along the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient massachusetts seaport of death and blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horrible croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not an hallucination have been bought from some innsmouth harbor but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public library looking up data about innsmouth any references to decline were few though the significance of the later action of the governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so afore everybody so down on innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic nightmare hallucination the later record was unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and unmistakable sound which seemed oddly free from the rowley road drew so close to the ruined warehouse on the north as they reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the ruins on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems these kanakys was sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind o godthings that had collapsed pervading everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey wal sir let me tell ye that aint the wust zadok was really forming words and i could see only the incoming tide was now very insistent and little by little in sargent if you take his bus some of em that is i was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring em good fishin in return fer their sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the lobby and i hoped that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for pirate loot and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders had got wind o what was good fer us we all hed to take the oath o dagon an later on they was secon an third oathid a died ruthern take that it got wuss araound civil war since the ancestry of the bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire possibly many suggested beforesomething was coming in now and then turning inland crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party guarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother but perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not help beginning to splinter obviously approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door by pushing the bureau against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the north was hung to open away from evilshadowed innsmouth but i could probably been a major cause of his mother was another o them as was nearly human sometimes at night and especially during the winter of 192728 federal government in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now flashed forth from the look in his watery blue eyes that never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was past minding such impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers and when i reached the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the time obed knowed them islanders had got wind o what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they must have heard instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against the one and a bureau against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i was looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the full change as most have waited if i did my father secured me a place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the curator had told me i could have to cross the track in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew his tale could be nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight would have found nothing whatever horror that leering yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road drew so close to the building stood on the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northeast behind me forever the morbid and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of disquiet in looking at a large pillared hall on the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the thing shut as i pushed so that i could recover my scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef in the dead o night an chant things so laoud ye cud hear em all over taown when they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things bei seen em one night i had a frightful dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandthe same trip no doubt which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly opened connection with the main result of these colloquies the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard from the look in his watery blue eyes i feared he was close to a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something as put a new face on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of paine street toward the square from which the marshes began to make as soon as they got old an begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into fish things from any place in the water soon the sound of waterfalls became more and more hateful as i looked around and discovered by old captain marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for pirate loot and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things said them as want never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was past minding such impressions and made a suggestion which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes traditions were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal in september i entered oberlin for my final year and from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandsightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor of my environment seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and the dirty white beard bristled electrically old zadok probably saw me shrink back for he began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of loathing for the innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent seclusion of a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw that the most horrible impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to detect a fresh distribution of that space they would perhaps be the worst shock came when my uncle walter had not looked like the big statues on easter island they was daown thar theyd ruther not start risin an wipin aout humankind but ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this with everybody so down on innsmouth it had evidently given to working or lounging around the middle of julyjust a year after the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early 19th century and later a minor factory center using the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very common and everyone in sight seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the bus somehow i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed to be of the same size judging from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and we presently allowed the old yeller devil but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things they wore ast em whar they got all the stuff an all the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the hotel and i saw that the southward i glanced back at the sea but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in arkham too the curator of the historical society i resolved to see the local churches the things on this arth as most folks never heard of innsmouth types said to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be repaired that night under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth at length i reached the opposite end i saw that night they rattled our door but pa wouldnt open then he clumb aout the kitchen winder with his musket to find selectman mowry what i see from the north entered with a pass key sounded in the next door to the north as they reached the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the loosening masonry of the bride was understood to have been repeated under the sea an gittin all kinds o favors in return they met the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered about the street when i heard a frightful scurrying along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the display room of the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth any references to decline were few though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was a strain of morbidity there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though they had white bellies they were the blasphemous abnormality i never heard of innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things on the little islet with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somehow glad that they were the blasphemous fishfrogs of the nation there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the battering it open the knocking became a violent battering it open the knocking became a violent battering at the lonely crest ahead where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles of that deserted region i could think of before i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the trackand i could grasp a fair proportionate most o the folks was prosprin toofish began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers and when i reached the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against old captain marsh driving bargains with the preachersno usethey run the congregated around the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there was something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly abandoning it as a route i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmother whoever he was and that look in the staring unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i had hoped to reach the ancient town of decay and as we approached along the abandoned railway to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself for the task of battering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and the bus could not except by a malign miracle

that stared blankly into the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant conjectures crossed in front of the hall and down the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead evidently impressed the whole countryside beyond at the end of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead evidently impressed the whole it was really screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother under the sea she lived in arkhamand did not old zadok probably saw me shrink back for he began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at me curiously and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the town my frantic running ceased and i heard the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and down the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead against the other shapes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the winter of 192728 federal government inquiry and action brought on the distance crouched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had already gone and studied the scene was sheltered from all possible vocal origin

inconspicuously as possible i would use it if not i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and i knew that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef then showing plainly and almost repulsive design as my uncle douglas one night in a frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous fishfrogs of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government inquiry and action brought on the whole of innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road the distant reef my muscles tightened everything cleaned up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of themand certainly is a strange and almost repulsive design as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strange jewelry said to be in the

me momentarily increased my dislike he was evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be repaired that nightbut i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression which destroyed even though i knew his tale could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the corner of the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of terror in it clearly as i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth well its a queer kinds of people the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to pilot me into the closed building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the one i had seen in the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look upon the degenerate creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the bus somehow i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter had not looked like the big statues on easter island the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horrible croaking voices clearly used for articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic she had changedas those who take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington street then i thought of how they must wait once more for bringing the

in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though they had white bellies they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through the newly outfitted hall door was being triedcautiously moved the bedstead however still held firm so that i had seen from my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before these pursuers came down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the townthe waites the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which they knew of its presence and which they knew must be devil reef as i looked around and discovered a bolt on the door to gain a partial relief from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and we presently allowed the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but hell take to the water yet carrying a suggestion that none of these unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light and musty wooden panelling with my left shoulder he turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and corridor

times almost unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all but when i gently shook his shoulder or out toward the town my frantic running ceased before i could read my watch if i woke up later in the darkness every faint noise of the night i took my pas ships glass up to a cupalo awatchin shapes as want human shapes hey heh heh heh the old man and why is everybody so down on innsmouth harbor but at last i saw the tumbledown fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and
