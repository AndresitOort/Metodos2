andsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport still fresh they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road drew so close to the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor toward the roar of the falls in the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all i perceived that one figure was strangely robed and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar again groping toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew his tale could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like him to work in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i would never die but go back to the mother hydra an father dagon what we all come from onctia ia cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
