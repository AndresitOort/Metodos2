 him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water changeand told me she had never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned at considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful scurrying along the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef in the dead o night an chant things so laoud ye cud hear em all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the island but the capn cud read folks like they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the water an quittin the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess the others was satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some lookin an thinkin fer itself too many folks missintoo much wild preachin at meetin of a sundaytoo much talk abaout that reef i guess i done a bit by tellin selectman mowry what i see from the cupalo they was a party one night as follered obeds craowd aout to the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the dories nex day obed an thuttytwo others was in jail with everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there as marks clearly showed but there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo from boston and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal in september i entered oberlin for my final year and from then till the next june was busy with studies and other wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connection with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to show it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested beforesomething which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of but the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along the abandoned railway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to change the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was nothing there and when i reached water street was almost its duplicate save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like him to work in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i would never die but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night in a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably shut me up in a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been noticed in this hotel in newburyport they told me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road in plain sight in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all i perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i noticed that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth spose one night ye seed somethin heavy heaved offen obeds dory beyond the reef an then larned nex day a young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody nothin yet im agoin to naow yew jest set still an listen to me boythis is what i aint never told nobody i says i didnt get to do no pryin arter that nightbut i found things aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things till finally theyd take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of arrests the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the low distant line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the low distant line of devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like that back of the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space was as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached water street was almost its duplicate save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew his tale could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruined warehouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the corner of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon hall at new church green those churches were very oddall violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlight the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better attack the northward connecting door before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south a suggestion which made me uneasy it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source whose husband lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along washington street toward the reef and despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square recrossing the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that the safest course was ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o monsters jest like they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time that refinery though used to be a big thing and old man marsh who owns it must be richern croesus queer old duck though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to have developed some skin disease

whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door was now terrific and i saw that there would be no other passengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead against the loosening masonry of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connection with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the door of the gilman house i was glad to see the moonlight and i thought of how they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before my

renew those nervous glances over his shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface thats haow the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnameable abysses of blackness inside and as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and alienation i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead against the loosening masonry of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connection with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the door of the church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth spose one night ye seed somethin heavy heaved offen obeds dory beyond the reef an then larned nex day a young feller why capn obed an twenty odd other folks used to row aout to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the staring unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful scurrying along the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door was wide open but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce they were he said of very grotesque and terrifying the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only things they wore ast em whar they come from into the taownben doin it fer years an obed got enough o that goldlike stuff to make him start the refinery in waites old rundaown fullin mill wall come abaout thuttyeightwhen i was seven year oldobed he faound the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the water soon the sound of the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned down paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something subtler and more puzzling in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
