s respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode i was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality i never heard of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were those who said she could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county histories on the library shelves had very little to say except that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early 19th century and later a minor factory center using the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the country references to decline were few though the significance of the later record

recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space was as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street reentering the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street reentering the square i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street around the corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas her eldest son he had shot himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical society i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had never liked him either something about it he was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said innsmouth well its a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves

devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the end of shipping days

certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folk as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his

since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo from boston and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal in september i entered oberlin for my final year and from then till the next june was busy with studies and other wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connection with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the middle of julyjust a year after the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh

the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door on the south side of the room it was designed to open in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming

mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were those who said she could have told more than she did but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on it that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
