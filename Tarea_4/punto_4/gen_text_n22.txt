ing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our

back and narrow head became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad

gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette bates adams and banks streetsthe latter skirting the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon but my route would not force me to cross it during my second pause i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space bound outward along eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction and knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily be looking and possible eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth native i had not quite crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of those very extreme innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts

foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to show it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth the essex county histories on the library shelves had very little to say except that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early 19th century and later a minor factory center using the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the country references to decline were few though the significance of the later record was unmistakable after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university at arkham and in the display room of the newburyport historical society i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me uneasy it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton was inclined to believe that it

vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient massachusetts seaport of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of arrests the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothing positive ever developed complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the government in the end only one papera tabloid always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth harbor but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth for my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman and i have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode i was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality i never heard of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered you could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room it was designed to open in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english their features were indistinguishable but their crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that one figure was strangely robed and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar again groping toward the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the rays of my flashlight i found i could open the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner i walked rapidly softly and close to the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space where eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor imaginable and i was not to reach my destination without one other very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town all this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away ii shortly before ten the next morning i stood with my one small valise in front of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i had noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes together with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment certain kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose deaths had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the street signs were down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks thus began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution by the present town square recrossing the gorge on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street was almost its duplicate save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the falls in the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing federal street safely north of the green and entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adams streets following washington street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street reentering the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked

crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youths map and seeking a route i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of state for my approach to town square near the corner of fall street i began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers and when i finally reached the square i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street around the corner of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity showed signs of disappearing and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced

on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i

a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon but my route would not force me to cross it during my second pause i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space bound outward along eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction and knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily be looking and possible eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth native i had not quite crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of those very extreme innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to show it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i was glad to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job there was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green those churches were very oddall violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly shocking enoughand their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house i was glad to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the

chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adams streets following washington street toward the river i now faced a zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my right the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister bus it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street reentering the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the lobby and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to stop over at the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollar despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to read i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for somethinglistening for something which i dreaded but could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realized the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transfer first i reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of sound then gathering from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room it was designed to open in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a pass key for an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete then with a dazed automatism i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the lobby and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to stop over at the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beacons it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette bates adams and banks streetsthe latter skirting the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible in babson street i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon but my route would not force me to cross it during my second pause i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space bound outward along eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction and knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily be looking and possible eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth native i had not quite crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge the vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded i was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at a grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road the marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second what i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of those very extreme innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers that flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort and then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the

wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to show it was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sell as the good lady showed me out of the building she assured me that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches it was called she said the esoteric order of dagon the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it a very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic

altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room it was designed to open in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer door for a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land the clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the lobby and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to stop over at the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep

maidens to some kind o godthings that lived under the sea an gittin all kinds o favors in return they met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins an it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o these things mebbe they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o cities on the seabottom an this island was heaved up from thar seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface thats haow the kanakys got wind they was daown thar made signtalk as soon as they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things liked human sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was all right with the heathens because theyd ben havin a hard time an was desprate abaout everything they give a sarten

the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an jine the main lot o things daown thar an this is the important part young fellerthem as turned into fish things an went into the water wouldnt never die them things never died excep they was kilt violent wal sir it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water an quittin the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an was willin to pay heavy an i guess the others was satisfied fer a while come in fortysix the taown done some

he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder and it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shown only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up grayly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the hour was past noon the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society this uncle had resembled her and i had never liked him either something about the staring unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle douglas one night i had a frightful dream in which i met my grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic she had changedas those who take to the water changeand told me she had never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i would never die but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night in a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic she had changedas those who take to the water changeand told me she had never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol

gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them for the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth look so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
