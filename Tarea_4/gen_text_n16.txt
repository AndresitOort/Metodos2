es of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like the big statues on easter island they was a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the master of a ship genlly profited the crew proportionate most o the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was in bad shape because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too well thens the time obed begun to git on his feet agin folks see his three darters awearin goldlike things as nobodyd never see on em afore an smoke started comin aout o the refinry chimbly other folks was prosprin toofish began to swarm into the harbor fit to kill an heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to ship aout to newbryport arkham an boston twas then obed got the ol branch railrud put through remember i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the few as hadnt got none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands walakea give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the things was scattered all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the island but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgreatgrandmother had been a marsh of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away for i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow thats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them for the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me uneasy it was as if the bus were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence after all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers and it was not always safe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years before my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my imagination another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly showed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette bates adams and banks streetsthe latter skirting the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youths map and seeking a route i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of state for my approach to town square near the corner of fall street i began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers and when i finally reached the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbor tides and the roar of the falls in the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing federal street safely north of the green and entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university at arkham and in the display room of the newburyport public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerlyproportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip the place inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls the hallway inside was black and when i reached water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess i was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the coach the bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
