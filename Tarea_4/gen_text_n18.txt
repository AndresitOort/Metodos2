ing gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify once more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end the rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to stop over at the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen iv i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread the open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef then without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth who were they why were they here and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant there were sounds tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a pass key then the lock of the connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth it was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in stretching inland i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odor of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand the northward connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth at length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized come face to face with rumorshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever
