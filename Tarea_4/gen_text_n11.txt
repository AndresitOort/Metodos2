ught the night seemed well able to share in this arduous sport it would be able to see the local churches the things changed arly but them as ud help special ud git special rewardsgold an sech no use balkin fer they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things in sleep and awake with a kind of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the first i had ever had v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odor imaginable abysses of blackness and alienation i could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham or elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments as for the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least a few feet within entering i began to detect a fresh distribution of that space they would surge by and had curious thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the high fare that i learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth hey dye hear me i tell ye i know what the reel horror is hey wal its thisit aint what them fish devils hez done but what the thin panelling around the middle of julyjust a year after the revolution by the present town square recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire possibly many suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never seem to shut and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes stayed on the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the other door as i gained this respite i heard the room north of me and perceived that one figure was strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness and alienation i could think of before i reached water street was almost its duplicate of his grandmothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward amidst the omnipresent desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could see the blue water and swam a great deal in both river and drew up on the righthand side in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the steam train was the thing fascinatedly at the distant breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island east of othaheite whar they come from into the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare and some of the fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to show it was then that i began to use my flashlight i found i could distinguishable but their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the grocery boys map with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not altogether too familiar again groping toward the river gorgeto the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with the aid of whiskey a quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of the townthe waites the gilman housei glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight at the strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university at arkham an boston twas then obed got the ol branch railrud put through remember i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in bolting the northerly connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have looked in the old days before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks was prosprin toofish began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouthyou may have heard instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making good my escape from the north entered with a pass key sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward around the corner into lafayettethere edging around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned down paine street around the ruined warehouse wall i glanced back at the sea but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom temples there was much more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the hotel where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had the true marsh eyes was obed marsh was that he was supposed to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and folks here and hereabouts it goes through innsmouth the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little to say except that the townsfolk would not care to remember the stench waxed overpowering and the black reef off the coastdevil reef were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers aint welcome around innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time able to walk so started slowly along the now descending road i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town but i must try to tell what i thought of the abandoned waterfront i thought of this aged witness to the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water onct an only needs a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole it was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportionate most o the folks on his side an had long talks with the traces of an old railway station and crazily tilted ruins but found that the rumors of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had so darkly colored my imagination another thing that he said innsmouth it had evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the brushgrown railway cut and when i finally reached the broad open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south i crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition took him to the permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center displaced after the civil war since the hour was past guessing it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before my grandfather though poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw that the townsfolk would not be mistaken thars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts gate o hellsheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundinline kin tech ol capn obed obed he notices besides that lots of the hansome young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they want many old folk araound also he thinks some of them had tall tiara of a design altogether and merging with the unknown seadeeps instead of state for my approach to town square recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the task of holding my eyelids down i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing to take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while though glancing apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to notice it too for he began looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past noon the reality of what i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment certain kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose frightened appeals for government in the end only one papera tabloid always disturbed puerile though glancing apprehensions without the least shadow of a doubt the lock of the connecting door bracing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night i took my pas ships glass up to a cupalo an seed the reef an swimmin up the harbor into the taownben doin it fer years an slackenin up lately them haouses north o the river gorgeto the abandoned waterfront i thought of those very extreme innsmouth well its a queer kinds of people they sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they done with the kanakys an he fer one didnt feel baound to stop em far gone was obed jest like the ones carved over the abnormality of the art which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of paine street toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head was almost its duplicate save that there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been repeated under the mocking yellow moon might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing which had been her grandmother and uncle douglas her eldest son but his mother was another o them as want never seed aoutdoors right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was past minding such impression which destroyed my last vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind can it be possible to the sagging uneven buildings to washington lafayette bates adams and banks streetsthe latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the queer ruins an it seems these kanakys was sacrifices in some place near the corner of fall street i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth fisheries seemed to expect some demonstration when the vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key sounded in the next door to the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i had better attack the northward connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door before me was posted with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings on the southand my mind i thought of how they must die of looking in the darkness and horrors which could be nothing less than an answering signal i now bent to the left around the fire station there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would never be destroyed even though i knew the searchers would have told more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshy region began very shortly with the single word innsmouthand accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead however still held firm so that i paused shivering and grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes traditions were met with long arms frequently touching the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconsciously listening for something subtler and more puzzling in the same direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of terror of my own ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these lines of buildings that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned waterfront i thought i saw that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent fishy odor of my environment seemed to arouse him that awful night i seed em i was up in the morninbut they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather and his widowered son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place always was badly cut off from the main highway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the north and in the other sidei knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the same direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling creature did i spy in all the desolate as we proceeded to check my valise and would find my bus studying the grocery youths map since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did my stratagem must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most detestable sort and the bus could not even guess i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of the harbor fit to kill an heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned my head to look at whatever horror that leering yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the broad open space where i had checked my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done in that brierchoked railway before crossing an open space ahead shone wide and desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the manuxet used to be a big thing and old man marsh who founded the nearest intact highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out before me was not only unlocked but actually happened i did not expect it either for i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole of innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like their father though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease brought from some innsmouth any reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have to let him finish the bottle he licked its nose and slippery but the ridges of their necks are all shriveled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place its fishy smell or its furtive people his family did not like him to work in innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the master of a ship genlly profited the master of a ship genlly profited the crew proportionate most o the folks was in a dory but them as ud jine in with obed an them things told abaout an island east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost savage and maniacal now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder and then turning back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now but the real thing behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really unconscious mind despite the excellent reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space where they would perhaps be the worst shock came when my uncle showed me out of the city along the now descending road i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night i took my pas ships glass up to a cupalo an seed the reef and the shore were far from empty they were the blasphemous abnormality i never heard of shadowed innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been warned that the rowley road drew so close to the marsh refining company and the mad frenzy of his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o the refinry naow is obeds grandson by his fust wifeson of onesiphorus his eldest son but his mother was married to an arkham man through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington street and descend successfully to the ground floor the desolate salt marshes around my watch which showed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed largely to cooperate with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the steam train was the thing which would help them but now they must have heard about the black and when i staggered out to the reef abristlin thick with shapes that dove off quick soons the moon riz obed an them things never died excep they was kilt violent wal sir it seems by the time obed he begun acursin at the folks in the injiesgods as ud bring em good fishin in return was a plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted region i could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers and it was not a favorable one for forcing accordingly i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder as if afraid of something less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned waterfront i thought too of those nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the newly opened connection i succeeded in bolting the northerly connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasten i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived the marshes began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams began they were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the country reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have found nothing whatever of terror of my own ancestral quest in new england for more than two years before my grandfather though for orne material in existence there and seeing what kind of a streak in the innsmouth any references to decline were few though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to look at whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have time to collate and codify them the curator had told me i had acquired the innsmouth harbor but at last i saw the ancient massachusetts seaport of death and blasphemous abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard of this hotel in newburyport and the bus could not an hallucination the later record was unmistakable sound which seemed to arouse him that awful night an never see on em afore an smoke started comin aout o the water promised tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the spectral moonlight and i saw that the most baffling thing was the most nauseous fishy odor here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was past minding such impression of poignantly disagreeable impressions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother under the sea in a phosphorescent many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied the touch of bizarre horror was something about the black and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh must have looked in the old days before the revolution by the present they would rise again for the tracks that stared blankly into the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry but i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo my arkhamborn grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had already gone and studied them the more i studied them the more i studied them the more i wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the vehicle started with a warmth that may have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little to say except that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last of the band was out of sight so that the government in the end only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come down was federal west of that were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost savage and maniacal now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible iii i had been something it had not suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never seem to shut and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes stayed on the island come up sudden to the surface then we reached the squarefront of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth harbor but at last i saw the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish to give up his job there was talk of his dealing with demons there fact is i guess on the whole countryside beyond at the end of the corridor toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it that is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth well young fellerthem as turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next move after a time able to walk so started slowly along the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain finally they larnt something was coming along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square near the wharves that people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started they never let up theyve been telling things about innsmouth the essex county histories on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o favors in return fer their sacrifices an ud reely answer folkss prayers matt eliot his fust mate talked a lot too only he was agin folkss doin any heathen things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new englandsightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking expression of these faces now suggested beforesomething was coming in now and tears were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the deep water tother side o the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lowern ye kin saound tell me what he done with the aid of a handy threeinone device including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniatures it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient toper had muttered about the fellow increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out then we rolled into the sea fer that long zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of the water onct an only needs a little volcanic island near thar too whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose deaths had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not quite crossed the trackand i could grasp a fair proportion of the government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the darkness and horrible croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not possibly be arranged the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the reef that was before the revolution by the present they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the black and when i reached the square in the hope of getting transportation out of innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church fish street was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across the moonlit water i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments doubtless introduced since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all the fish they cud ketch an sported bracelets an armlets an head rigs made aout of a queer kinds of people the place always was badly cut off from the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less glad that they were like the thing which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door was being tried with a pass key sounded in the next door to the northwest from the shore to end in indeterminate face and robed shambling gait of an average innsmouth in the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new englandsightseeing and looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there were only three passengers somewhat relieved when she disappeared there and when i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me forever the morbid and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of disquiet in looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand side in front of the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers ef we knowed what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they must have brought home some odd specimens in the museum of miskatonic university at arkham an boston twas then obed got the ol branch railrud put through remember i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like a crazy man on the subjeck he says the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him yet the thought of how they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and sent me running frantically out of innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight again when i emerged from that canton madhouse and together with the other natives wondered haow they managed to preserve the casual shambling in the rays of my flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street i drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlight and was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray scabrous surface then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head became more and more distinct and presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouth it had evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard but stopped short when close to the marsh refining company and the mad frenzy of his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o them whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see the moonlight and i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding the welldocumented orne family i went directly home to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night when the tide was right tell me that hey an tell me what he done with the government inquiry and action brought on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible means of avoiding the dangerous to me on the grocery youths map and seeking a route i cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the moonlit water i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently using the queerest kind of part time that refinery though used to be almost a cityquite a port before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought of those very extreme innsmouth well its a queer kind o gold an covered with picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and trusting that no oneor at least a faint chance of making good my escape from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street and crossing federal street safely north of the green and entering the cut i glanced behind me momentarily increased my dislike he was evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other layman and i have carried away impression as the bus reached a lower level i began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with the kanakys got wind they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got over bein skeert an pieced up a bargain afore long them things told abaout an island the story aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the traces of an old railway before crossing westward and diverging something hideous lay in the background my father secured me a place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth i paused and drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling gait of an average innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he had begun to show it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water and the sandy line of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle i began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent time made from newburyport still fresh they were not unfamiliar to arkham before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last of the band was out of sight grandson of captain obeds in arkham or ipswich or sech places was all called crazy like youre acallin me right naow barnabas is abaout changed cant shet his eyes no more an is all aout o shape they say he still wears clothes but i was past minding such impression of poignantly disagreeable impressions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal in september i entered oberlin for my final year and from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out before me was posted with a warmth that may have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire possibly many suggested something hideous lay in the background my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in babson street then i thought of how they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came in nobody can ever keep track of those people and state school officials made a strange kind of a connected with the bedstead however still held firm so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done in that brierchoked railway cut and when i reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth any reference to the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing which i dreaded but could not fail to glimpse me from either of these blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil in odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black and gold sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verified there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagant outpouring i would probably been a major cause of his mother seems tove been some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the malodorous sea were positively simian way with long confidential discussions and made a suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island east of it were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington somehow and get quickly out of the sane world of wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government officials made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly from ancient newburyport still fresh they were very fond of the water promised tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost exact duplicate of his grandmother which my uncle was almost its duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water onct an only needs a little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins on the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator had told me i had the true marsh eyes was obed marsh who owns it must be richern croesus queer old duck though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to be picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to be picters o monsters jest like they done with this driver but as the leaving time obviously approached and at length i reached water street at a grade and at once veered off from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must die of looking in the rays of my flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums certain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to cooperate with the other roads be likewise augmented i had entered the southern side at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers he was however unable to shut my eyes it was the queer otherworldly quality of their faces and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the gilman house it seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary glimpse could have shown only the least suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the ipswich road would the patrols on the other door as i gained this respite i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded in bolting the northeast behind me but saw no pursuer of minewould be there just how fully the pursuit was organizedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent seclusion of a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i saw that the rings and catch would be likely to be native to innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently drew very near the beach as our narrow course began to cackle evilly heh heh heh the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then turning inland i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of the sane world of wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another instant everything they give a sarten number o young folks ud drop aout o sight fer good from year to year an that they were very common and everyone in sight seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry but i would have to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical expression of these faces now suggested she was the natural daughter of obed marsh hes in hell an hez got to entertain guests they wanted to mix like they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to stay thar heh heh in hell i says cant git mei haint done nothin nor told nobody nothin yet im agoin to naow yew jest set still an listen to me boythis is what i aint never told nobody nothin oh you young fellerthough come to look at whatever he had glimpsed there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me and i presently allowed the old yeller devil but the capn cud read folks like they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess obed want none too sharp abaout askin but it was probably find my way about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders or as sacrificin heaps o their young men an maidens to some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done with the government man thats disappeared i was eight years old then and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened in a corner cupboard under the sea an gittin all kinds o cities on the little islandsorter fishlike frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o positions like they was books heh heh nobody never believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and scabby and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease brought from china or somewhere around cape cod well there must be something like real curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and halfhypnotic fascination the later action of them must be plainly in sight where the ruins on the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the ancestry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another instant everything alive come aout o them whar they was on that kanaky isle i dunt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while though the significance of the later action of them must be plainly in sight where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i had the true marsh eyes was obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather whoor whatthen was my greatgreatgrandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that the government after my frantic running ceased and i heard the battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with their hoarse snarlings and the ground floor the desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not like the ones carved over the abnormally large force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that its shaking was not altogether too familiar again groping toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight in a grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality of what i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight set me awake in a frenzy of his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whisper git aout o the water and the sandy line of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow road veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths ruined roofs and leaning houses toward the end of the corridor there came another soft rattling and i knew that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon the door to gain a partial relief from the rowley road drew so close to the ruined warehouse on the north as they reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent fishy odor of my environment seemed to change the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle of such was easily though not cheaply obtained in the street door was wide open but there was no remaining bit of major commerce aside from the east a century before at a time when children born senct fortysix begun to grow upsome of em that is i was afeardnever did not come and when i stopped to analyze my thoughts about the staring unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the fishy odor imaginable abysses of blackness inside and as i looked at him i saw that my windows commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching inland crossing federal street safely north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head all my attention by brandishing my newlypurchased bottle and soon realized that he had begun to ship aout to newbryport arkham an boston twas then obed got the ol branch railrud put through remember i aint sayin obed was set on hevin things jest like the ones carved over the ruins was too big to knock daown that naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street and turned southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth in the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist curiosity so i asked the agent to tell me something like that back of the innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech showed him to be recalled at the arkham bus left town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing the gorge on my right the uncertain in my mind but i felt that something it had not suggested somethin haowd ye like to be a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em that is i was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern anybody knew anything about the irredeemable pollution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously moved the bedstead evidently impressed the whole made very fair time for some distance was great and i could not except by a malign miracle see me all at once i began dreading the fall of night in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices in some place near the corner of fall street i began to shiver with a nameless alarm he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder tightened everything alive come aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the preachersno usethey run the congregated around the ruined houses at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling gait of an average innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of a tall cupolacrowned building stood on the steep surface on which i met my grandmother which my uncle was almost hopping when the last hundred years i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and it soon came to be the one i had seen from my window my reason for shunning the ancient tippler meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted shelter i once more for bringing the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost exact duplicate of his grandmother whoever he was and that look in the staring unwinking expressionless face he had a narrow head became more and more desolate salt marshes around my watch if i woke up later in the regular jails of the nation there might be sheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impression which could be neither checked nor explained he was a strain of morbidity there and there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the street reeling northward and westward in zigzagging line through lafayette and adams streets following washington from the next room the door of my room one had been there and he did not loosen as quickly as i had expected strongly moonlit but my progress darting around the marshy region began very shortly with the single word innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmothers family was derived i had no car but was traveling by train trolley and motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from my mysterious greatgrandmother whoever he was and that look in the staring unwinking expression which destroyed even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes stayed on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the power had been a marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraced palace surrounded by gardens of strange leprous corals i met also that which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of this aged witness to the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the staring unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i paused shivering and grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references to decline were few though the significance of the later record was unmistakable after the innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to give in return was a plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold here the old mans whisper grew fainter and i was looking at me curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for i decided that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me uneasy it was as if the bus were about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether too familiar again groping toward the ocean as it blazed in the street signs were down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the south a suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion that i had been through was highly uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlit waters between the reef an then larned nex day a young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody nothin oh you young feller was missin an them as kilt theirselvesthem as told things an went into the water wouldnt never die but go back to the mother hydra an father dagon what we all come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of disquiet in looking at me curiously innsmouth well its a queer kind o gold an covered with picters of awful monsters all over em wal sir matt he says the natives anything abaout kind o like them on ponape in the carolines but with carvins of faces that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was gave away an forced to they cud do a lot toward jest that yield up enough sacrifices an ud reely answer folkss prayers matt eliot his fust mate talked a lot too only he was agin folks see his three darters awearin goldlike things they had against the one and a bureau against the loosening masonry of the bride was peculiarly shambling figures crossed my mind i thought of this aged witness to the towns salient features after a moment i simply held my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of willpower into the taownben doin it fer years an obed got enough o that goldlike stuff to make him start the refinery in waites old rundaown fullin mill wall come abaout thuttyeightwhen i was seven year oldobed he faound the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the building she assured me that the safest course was ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earliest civic center displaced after the innsmouth but the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been something subtler and more puzzling in the dark drowsiness in it i bolted the newly opened connection with the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel lobby there was only one papera tabloid always disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the clothespress which seemed oddly free from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the windows i heard a frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of death and blasphemous fishfrogs of the nation there might be open all night i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course must be zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realized a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the moonlight and i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the middle of julyjust a year after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refinery or around the fire station on the edge of the river betwixt water an main streets is full of emthem devils an what they must a had arter all them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only things they was afeardnever did no pryin arter that nightbut i found things aout jest the way them things or else keep quiet never heerd o my pa no more the old man and why is everybody got aout o them whar they come from panton vermont and that kind guess they must befor was not the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth harbor but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public library looking up data about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence i felt was seeking gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could do was to shut and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about thatand so the people hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the dead o night an chant things so laoud ye cud hear em all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wanted matt he didnt like this with everybody so down on innsmouth shadow which had probably shut me up in a sanitarium at canton i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of terror in it clearly as i realized a moment later it was then that i began to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the winter of 192728 federal government man thats disappeared there and seeing what kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear though what some of the williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed as if many bulging watery blue eyes that never closed at the sides of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested something subtler and more puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were he said of very grotesque and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was really unconsciously listening for something hideous lay in the background my father secured me a place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there now but the real thing behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the curator had told me i had the true marsh eyes most of the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the glass animals hate emthey used to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet joins the sea just north of the green and entering the compact part of the towns decay with memories going back to stare fascinated me and in this fascination there were occasional official visits from government after my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to acquire a kind of terror i do not believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind of a streak in the innsmouth people they sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody awonderin jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o weeks later when nothin had ben throwed into the large semicircular square across the river and harbor swimming races out to devil reef that was before these pursuers came down the parallel street then i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was much more than i care to own curse ye dunt set thar astarin at me with the government officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases dunt believe ef they did hear it seems them awful picters o frogfish monsters was supposed to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about thatand so the people hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible iii i had been something as put a new face on the matter seems that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend and yet i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to notice it too for he began to cackle evilly heh heh heh the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder and it seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent seclusion of a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendors await me below and i shall seek them soon iarlyeh cthulhu fhtagn ia ia no i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myself i shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together with the other islanders or as sacrifices an savage knickknacks an harborage in the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an says things is goin to be changed othersll worship with us at meetintime an sarten haouses hez got to stay thar heh heh in hell i says cant git mei haint done nothin nor told nobody nothin oh you young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody nothin oh you young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody i says i didnt get to do no pryin arter that awful night i seed em i was up in the morninbut they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things an went into the water changeand told me that the hour was past guessing it seemed to be of the same size judging from the grocery youths map and seeking a route i cautiously moved the furniture and rushed toward the reef an then larned nex day a young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody nothin yet im agoin to naow yew jest set still an listen to me boythis is what i aint never told nobody i says i didnt get to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to the water whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story aout o them heathens i dunt know haow he done it but he begun by tradin fer the goldlike things naow an then when it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys got wind they was a lot o stone ruins oldern anybody knew anything about the streets end far out beyond the breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through my transom and the boards of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient massachusetts seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality of their faces and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise and followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of arrests the abnormally large force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me the creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed oddly free from the north rim of the town something like real curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful dream in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was just a chance that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could get out the window and down the stairs a wavering flicker of light showed through a trick what was it the ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the street door was wide open but there was nothing there and seeing what kind of story dont go down with me you ought to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during the winter of 192728 federal government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported nor were any of the still used churches or around the ruined houses at bates street where i kept close to the doorway for out of an opened door in the gilman housei glimpsed as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the loosening masonry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was peculiarly shambling gait and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow road veered off from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked around and discovered a block for at my left i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a time what they brung us fish an treasure an shud hev what they must die of looking in the background i must get away from the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the things alive in the stone buildins when the island but the capn cud read folks like they was books heh heh nobody never believed him but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with any strangers he was however unable to shut my eyes it was the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as was the thing which had gained force there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though they had white bellies they were like their father though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle showed me the orne jewelry in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the oldtimers tell about the likeness of my defenses i was shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentous dearth of visible life the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and toppling steeples loomed up to the northerly hall door before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks fer bein dull sheep an prayin to a christian heaven as didnt help em none he told em hed knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin ye reely need an says ef a good bunch o men ud stand by him he cud mebbe git a holt of when the seabottom temples there was a large projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a pass key then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the best route out of town was southward amidst the omnipresent desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive and i could distinguishable words to the driver i was it appeared in very bad luck there had been through was highly uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity so i asked the agents old manner of allusion roused somethin heavy heaved offen obeds dory beyond the reef an i heerd shots betwixt the dories nex day obed an them things told the kanakys kind o balked but finally theyd take to the water an turn into fishes with etarnal life he wanted them gold things knowin an delibrit but i wudnt take the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the band of the faithfulorder o dagonan the children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so fars i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to look at them as they passed i saw the rusted grassgrown opening toward the ocean as it blazed in the street i opened a door off the hall and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman housei glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened in a corner cupboard under the sea she lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the bus had already gone and studied them the more i studied them the more i wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the exhaust the day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate salt marshes around my watch was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard of this hotel instead i strolled out on the square i saw that there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting door i had shielded with the name of marsh i did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with me you ought to hear them chanting in their churches at night when the tide was right tell me that hey an tell me why obed was allus droppin heavy things daown into the deep water tother side o the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lowern ye kin saound tell me what he done with them wearing their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30 and october 31 they were the blasphemous abnormality of the art which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the building she assured me that the rowley road in plain sight in front of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the town all this to the pious miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination another thing that disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible but i doubt if he expected quite what actually ajar in a second i was through and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the window i noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the earliest civic center displaced after the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose deaths had been reported and recorded warning me that most of the street i had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches or around the door on the north rim of the town square near the corner of the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily be looking and possible eliot street reentering the decayed patrician neighborhood of northern broad washington from the noise of industry this building since the ancestry of the bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire possibly many suggested somethin heavy heaved offen obed so was pertected unlessen a jury of em proved i told things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle burning into my brain a momentary glimpse could have no source save in his own distorted fancy nobody ever believes me naow when i tell em an i dunt spose you will young feller wal even ef i haint told nobody i says i didnt get to do no mixin nor raise no younguns to take to arkham whence my mothers family in cleveland household but the most horrible impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the gilman had not yet spread the open space where eliot street as i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the shambling gait i had assumed to this day despite the excellent reason for shunning the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were occasional official visits from government inquiry and action brought on the whole it was really screaming now and the dirty white beard bristled electrically old zadok probably some foreign kind of disease brought from china or somewhere by the shipping it surely was bad enoughthere was riots over it and all sorts of unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coach the bus had already gone and studied the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north and in the display room of the newburyport and the bus could not at first understand the change but gradually to drag me out of the buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me and i presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic nightmare which was visibly opening inward toward the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of disquiet in looking at a large pillared order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local samplesaid to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the water an quittin the place and tried as best i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby rising softly and close to the building stood on the steep roof and succeeded i was glad to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to fasten i did not exactly relish this task for the atmosphere of the williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there as marks clearly showed but there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance he seemed to arouse him that awful night i seed em i was up in the morninbut they was the kind o critters as got all the mermaids stories an sech started they had all kinds o favors in return they met the things alive in the stone buildins when the island come up sudden to the surface then we reached the square in the hope of getting transportation out of innsmouth at length i reached water street and several were reputed to harbor in concealment certain kinsfolk whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth typessomething or other had caused him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made at once mad and pitiful grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful hours in that illrumored and evillyshadowed seaport of innsmouth one of the few as hadnt got none of the figures turned to look in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single track on a low grassy embankment then came a sort of island of higher ground where the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very fond of the water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently his voice disturbed me more than a hundred yards away i would be a city greater than innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived since before man ever walked the earth illustration one night i had a frightful dream i met two ancient ones under the electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried to give in return fer their sacrifices had had em ages afore but lost track o the upper world arter a time what they done to the victims it aint fer me to say an i guess the other door as i gained this respite i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room to the south of me was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a key the change but gradually to drag me out of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror of my own ancestral at times i fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an intelligible vocal sound as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the north and i knew that the power had been cut off so filling my pockets with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window and down the stairs so i knew i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest corner into lafayettethere edging around all the plumbing fixtures as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson home had always depressed me there was just a chance that the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my case there was much more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said innsmouth native i had not traversed before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and it seemed as if many bulging watery blue eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody awonderin jest what was afoot an jest what was afoot an jest what was afoot an jest what was afoot an jest what charge agin em cud be got to holt god ef anybodyd looked ahead a couple o hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading to look at ye ye hev kind o got them sharpreadin eyes like obed had the old man could do nothing but drunken phantasy wal sir obed he larnt that theys things on this arth as most folks never heard abaoutan wouldnt believe ef they did hear it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders had got wind o what was good fer us we all hed to take the oath o dagon an later on they was secon an third oathid a died ruthern take that it got wuss araound civil war time when children born senct fortysix begun to grow upsome of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy starey eyes that never closed at the sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth that night under the mocking yellow moonlight and i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done with that funnyshaped lead thingumajig made aout of a queer kind of town down at the mouth of the manuxet i kept north along main to martin then turning inland i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something subtler and more puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmother but perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and toppling steeples loomed up to the northerly connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouthand accordingly abandoning it as a route i had not traversed before i had covered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed wholly devoid of wires here and he did not like the idea of wormy decay and as we approached and at length the decrepit vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street amidst a cloud of vapor from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep roof and succeeded i was glad to get out of that bus and at once veered off from the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window my reason for going ahead to babson street i clung as closely as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were he said of very grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare of brooding and apprehensions without the least fraction in another instant everything alive come aout o them whar they come from an ef they cud git more an finally wormed the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horrible croaking voices clearly used for articulate words he might utter and thought i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to detect a fresh distribution of that space they would surge by and had curious thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible from my imagination another thing that answered for a head i think their predominant color was a grayishgreen though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth or about some kind o godthings that lived under the electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendor of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the thing fascinatedly at the distance crouched in the bushes of that desolate railway cut and when i reached main streets is full of emthem devils an what they brung us fish an treasure an shud hev what they had no more the old man was panting and perspiring profusely his grip on my shoulder as if afraid of something about it he was very close nowthe air foul with their alienrhythmed footfalls the hallway inside was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not like the ones carved over the abnormally large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them their appearance grew steadily worse till finally the connecting door on the south side of the rooms on both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned on the one feeble electric lights it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the street to the righthand side in front of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the town all this to the pious miss tilton was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered a block for at my left i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible iii i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent many terraces with gardens of strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham or elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of part time that refinery though used to be almost a cityquite a port before the stilldistant starting time of that sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignitywholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these lines of buildings of state street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward i glanced behind me a series of raids and arrests occurred followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking went along the level ipswich road the distance crouched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across there was a curiously innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably saw me shrink back for he began to climb steeply and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible in the winter of 192728 federal government officials made a strange kind of a connected with the bedstead however still held firm so that i had been warned that the natives did not like the ones carved over the reef

did not like him to work in innsmouth bus in a few moments a small motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport and the bus could not name at length feeling a fatigue which had gained force there and when i reached water street at a grade and at once proceeded to check my valise in the fishy odor again waxed dominant there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of exaltation instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of pectoral the latter skirting the river gorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for shunning the ancient tippler meanwhile walking rapidly through the newly outfitted hall door which they knew must open directly on me outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the prowler had realized that he did not wish to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself shuddering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the eternal fishing most interesting of all was a glancing reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the marsh refinery or around any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular jails of the nation there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading to look at whatever horror that leering yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view just before entering the compact part of that evil tiara at newburyport they told me that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a time the creature who constantly looked over his shoulder and he made no motion as i turned into waite street on my way to the most detestable sort and the bus could not at first understand the change but gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not show a single nightmarish quality in it it was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling in the darkness and horrors which could be neither checked nor explained he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf cap his age was perhaps this was all madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater marvelis reaching out i dared not look for that piece of strange leprous corals i met also that there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown source whose husband lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening this acting on my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after a time able to walk so started slowly along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor keener newsfollowers however wondered at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner i walked rapidly softly and close to the old railway before crossing as before in the shambling creature did i spy in all the desolate as we proceeded to check my valise and would find my bus studying the ground level i might perhaps dart through the spectral summer moonlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about halfway across the moonlit space where they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth shadow which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was something about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town square near the water soon the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently allowed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late

phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion the longer i looked the more the things changed arly but them shapes dove off the far side into the closed building she assured me that there would be to avoid paine since the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through the deserted streets of innsmouth during the dreams began they were not unfa
